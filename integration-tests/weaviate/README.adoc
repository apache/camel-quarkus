The Weaviate integration tests use docker test container by default.

To run the `camel-quarkus-weaviate` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a Weaviate account and cluster (https://weaviate.io/).

Set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export WEAVIATE_API_KEY=#your-weaviate-apikey
export WEAVIATE_HOST=#your-weaviate-host
----
