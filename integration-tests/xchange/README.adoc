== Camel Quarkus XChange Integration Tests

By default the XChange integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-xchange` integration tests against the real APIs, you can set the following environment variable:

[source,shell]
----
export CAMEL_QUARKUS_START_MOCK_BACKEND=false
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
