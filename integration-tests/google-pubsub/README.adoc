== Google Pubsub integration tests

=== Local container

Google emulator differs a little bit from the real account.  For example there is a test which passes on local emulator but fails on real account (see an https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-18277[issue] in Camel project).

Tests are executed with local container, unless both `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` and `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` properties are set.

=== Real Google Pubsub

To run the Google Pubsub client library, you must first set up authentication by creating a service account key.
You can find more info in the https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication[documentation].
Required permissions are to create/read/write the topics and subscriptions.
There are several roles which contain all required permissions (for example `Pub/sub editor`).

When you have the **service account key** you can provide authentication credentials and project id by setting both environment variables:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json"
export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="#your_project"
```
