== Camel Quarkus Geocoder Integration Tests

By default the Geocoder integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run `camel-quarkus-geocoder` integration tests using google maps service, you will need a google cloud https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key[API key].

Then set the following environment variable:

[source,shell]
----
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-id
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
