Out of the box docker greenmail does not work with SSL/TLS.
Certificate has to be created - the guide can be seen in the issue https://github.com/greenmail-mail-test/greenmail/issues/448[#448].

Following steps were used for certificate creation.

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
 -keyout greenmail.key -out greenmail.crt -subj "/CN=localhost" \
 -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:localhost,IP:127.0.0.1"

openssl pkcs12 -export -out greenmail.p12 -inkey greenmail.key -in greenmail.crt
```
