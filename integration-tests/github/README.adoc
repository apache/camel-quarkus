== Camel Quarkus GitHub Integration Tests

By default the GitHub integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-github` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token[GitHub token].

Set the following environment variable:

[source,shell]
----
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your-token
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
