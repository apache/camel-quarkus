== AWS 2 grouped integration tests

This module allows executing all tests from `integration-tests-aws2/*` grouped together.

While grouping brings the benefit of faster native compilation
(compared to the sum of compilation times of all modules under `integration-tests-aws2/*`)
it is methodologically not as clean as running those tests in isolation.
Hence, this module is intended to be run instead of the tests under `integration-tests-aws2/*`
if, in the given situation, the speed matters more than isolation.

=== How the grouping works

The grouped module dynamically pulls all sources from the individual AWS test modules to its
`target/[test-]classes` directories.
`application.properties` files and service descriptors are concatenated using a Groovy script.

=== Mock backend vs. real service

Please refer to the README files in `integration-tests-aws2` for more details.
