She meowed her way through the streets, catching the attention of a kindhearted lady who stopped to pet her. The lady promised to keep an eye out for Whiskers and even gave her a name: Luna.\\n\\nWhiskers was a happy kitten, exploring every inch of her new home. She played with her stuffed bunny, chased after her owner's dog, and even snuggled up with her human friend under the covers. Luna was contentedly wandering around her home until one day, she went missing.\\n\\nThe lady searched high and low for Luna, but she couldn't find her anywhere. She called and texted Luna's name, hoping to hear her meowing back. But there was no response. The lady was heartbroken. She missed Luna dearly and wondered where she could have gone.\\n\\nAs the night wore on, the lady grew tired and went to bed. But she couldn't stop thinking about Luna and what had become of her. In the middle of the night, she woke up and decided to search again. This time, she searched the entire house from top to bottom. She even called the local animal shelter and asked if anyone had come forward with a missing kitten.\\n\\nFinally, after hours of searching, the lady found Luna hiding under a pile of blankets in her bedroom. She was overjoyed to see her again and couldn't believe she had been lost for so long. Luna meowed with joy as her owner cuddled her, realizing that she had been missing for far too long.\\n\\nFrom then on, Luna never ventured too far from home. She knew that her loving owner would always keep her safe and loved her no matter where she went. And so, Luna lived happily ever after, exploring her neighborhood with her owner by her side.\"},\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"done\":true,\"total_duration\":21623498118,\"load_duration\":5875285,\"prompt_eval_count\":70,\"prompt_eval_duration\":656861358,\"eval_count\":407,\"eval_duration\":20959809253}",
