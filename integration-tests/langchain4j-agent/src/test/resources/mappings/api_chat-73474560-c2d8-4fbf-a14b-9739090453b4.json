She loved to explore and was always on the lookout for new adventures. As she walked, she noticed a small black and white kitten wandering around in the distance. The kitten looked lost and scared.\\n\\nLily decided to help the little cat and went towards it. When she got closer, she realized that the kitten was very hungry and needed food. She quickly grabbed some scraps of meat from her bag and started to feed the kitten. The kitten was so grateful and immediately started following Lily wherever she went.\\n\\nAs they walked, Lily noticed that the kitten was getting smaller and smaller, and soon it was no bigger than a small ball. She realized that she had lost her cat somewhere along the way. She tried searching for it everywhere but couldn't find it.\\n\\nLily decided to go back home and gather some tools to help search for her missing cat. She searched high and low, but still couldn't find her. Just as she was about to give up, she heard a faint meowing sound coming from a nearby bush.\\n\\nShe went closer and found a tiny little kitten, just like the one she had lost. It was covered in fur and looked very hungry. Lily quickly gave it some food and water and took it back home with her.\\n\\nThe next day, Lily's cat arrived back at her house, looking much healthier and happier than before. She realized that sometimes losing something can lead to finding something even more special. From that day on, Lily made sure to keep a close eye on her pets and never let them go missing again.\"},\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"done\":true,\"total_duration\":18804978749,\"load_duration\":5522852,\"prompt_eval_count\":70,\"prompt_eval_duration\":670354296,\"eval_count\":354,\"eval_duration\":18128125696}",
