She had been missing him for days and couldn't bear to be without him. As she walked, the trees grew taller and the leaves rustled in the wind. Suddenly, she heard a faint meowing sound.\\n\\nLily followed the sound until she came across a small, shivering kitten. The kitten was lost, alone, and hungry. Lily scooped it up in her arms and brought it back to her cozy little cottage. She fed the kitten some milk and gave it a warm bed to sleep in.\\n\\nAs the days passed, Lily and the kitten became the best of friends. They explored the forest together, meowing for their lost Oliver. The kitten even learned how to climb trees like Oliver used to do.\\n\\nOne day, as Lily was returning home from her job at the market, she heard a familiar meowing sound. She followed the sound and found Oliver, safe and sound, sitting on a branch in the middle of the forest. He had been lost for days and was so grateful to be back with Lily.\\n\\nFrom that day on, Lily and Oliver were inseparable. They went on many adventures together, explored the forest, and meowed for their friends who were still missing. And every starlit night, they would sit under the moon and watch the stars, remembering all the love and adventure they had been through together.\"},\"done\":true,\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"total_duration\":14589866353,\"load_duration\":12078273,\"prompt_eval_count\":70,\"prompt_eval_duration\":628086646,\"eval_count\":315,\"eval_duration\":13880555059}",
