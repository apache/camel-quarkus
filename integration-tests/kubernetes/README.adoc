= Camel Quarkus Kubernetes Integration Tests

By default, tests are executed against a mock Kubernetes server configured to run in CRUD mode.
Meaning that any resources created by tests are modifiable, listable and deletable.

To test against a real cluster, some environment variables are required.

Disable the mock server.

[source,shell]
----
export CAMEL_QUARKUS_START_MOCK_BACKEND=false
----

Then provide the URL of your cluster.

[source,shell]
----
export QUARKUS_KUBERNETES_CLIENT_API_SERVER_URL=https://127.0.0.1:50239
