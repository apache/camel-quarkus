== Camel Quarkus Twilio Integration Tests

By default the Twilio integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-twilio` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a Twilio account https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio.

Then find your API https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/test-credentials[test credentials] and set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export TWILIO_USERNAME=your-user-name
export TWILIO_PASSWORD=your-password
export TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-account-sid
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
