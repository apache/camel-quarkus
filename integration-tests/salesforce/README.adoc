== Camel Quarkus Salesforce Integration Tests

To run the `camel-quarkus-salesforce` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a Salesforce developer account https://developer.salesforce.com/.

Next create a new 'Connected App' from the app manager page. You may need to adjust the OAuth policy settings for
`Permitted Users` and also `IP Relaxation` rules, depending on your needs. Also enable Change Data Capture for the 'Account' entity by visiting the Integrations -> Change Data Capture page.

You can find the app OAuth settings by choosing the 'view' option from the app manager page. Then set the following environment variables.

[source,shell]
----
export SALESFORCE_CLIENTID=your-salesforce-client-id
export SALESFORCE_CLIENTSECRET=your-salesforce-client-secret
export SALESFORCE_USERNAME=your-salesforce-username
export SALESFORCE_PASSWORD=your-salesforce-password

To regenerate the Salesforce DTO classes, run `mvn clean generate-sources -Pgenerate-salesforce-dtos`.
