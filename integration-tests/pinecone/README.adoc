== Camel Quarkus Pinecone Integration Tests

By default, the Pinecone integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-pinecone` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a Pinecone account at https://www.pinecone.io.

Then find your API keys in the management console and set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export PINECONE_API_KEY=your-api-key
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`

NOTE: At present, not all API interactions are recorded due to indexes using dynamic DNS and gRPC endpoints.
