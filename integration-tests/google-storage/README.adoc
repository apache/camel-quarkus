== Google Storage integration tests

=== Local container

Google storage container doesn't cover all the functionalities. (For example deleting of buckets is not implemented - see an
https://github.com/fsouza/fake-gcs-server/issues/214[issue])

Tests are executed with local container, unless `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` property is set.

=== Real Google Storage

To run the Google Storage client library, you must first set up authentication by creating a service account key.
You can find more info in the https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication[documentation].

When you have the **service account key** you can provide authentication credentials to your application code by setting the environment variable:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/user/Downloads/my-key.json"
```
