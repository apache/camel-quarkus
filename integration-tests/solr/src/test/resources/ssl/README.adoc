== Purpose and content of the individual files in this directory

* `solr-ssl.keystore.jks` the keystore containing the server certificate and private key to use when starting
  Solr container with SSL enbled. The password for both the store and the private key is `secret`.
* `solr-ssl.der` the same server certificate as in `solr-ssl.keystore.jks`, stored separately so that it is
  easier to add it to the JVM's trust store via `ExtendDefaultTrustStore.main()`
