== FIPS

Please utilize the fips profile when executing tests within a FIPS-enabled environment.
There are two profiles:

* Use `bcfips` profile to employ the BouncyCastle-FIPS security provider.
* Use `fips` profile to employ the SunPKCS11-NSS-FIPS security provider.


Example of usage:
```
mvn clean test -Dfips or mvn clean test -Dbcfips
```
