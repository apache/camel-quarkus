== Camel Quarkus Google BigQuery Integration Tests

To run Camel Google BigQuery integration tests, you need a valid https://cloud.google.com/[Google Cloud Platform] (GCP) account. Note that the GCP free tier & sandbox
mode does not provide the required capabilities (streaming inserts & queries) that enable the tests to run successfully.

The simplest means of setting up authentication is via a https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started[service account]. Use the GCP UI to export
a JSON representation of your credentials.

You should now set the following environment variable:

[source,shell]
----
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
----

You should also modify `application.properties` so that `quarkus.google.cloud.project-id` is correct for your GCP project.
