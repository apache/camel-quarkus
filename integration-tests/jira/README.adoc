== Camel Quarkus Jira Integration Tests

By default integration tests use WireMock to stub the Jira API interactions.

To run `camel-quarkus-jira` integration tests against a real Jira instance, set the environment variables described below.

[source,shell]
----
export JIRA_ISSUES_PROJECT_KEY=TEST
export JIRA_URL=http://localhost:8080/

# If your Jira server requires basic authentication
export JIRA_USERNAME=my-jira-username
export JIRA_PASSWORD=my-jira-password

# If your Jira server requires OAuth authentication
export JIRA_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
export JIRA_OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY=your-consumer-key
export JIRA_OAUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=your-private-key
export JIRA_OAUTH_VERIFICATION_CODE=your-code
----

If you want to test the issue transition producer, you may need to override the default a workflow transition id for your Jira instance.

[source,shell]
----
export JIRA_TRANSITION_ID=10
----

A simple way of setting up a Jira server is to use the https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/jira-software[Jira Docker image].

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
