== Camel Quarkus Zendesk Integration Tests

By default the Zendesk integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-zendesk` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a Zendesk account https://www.zendesk.com/register/.

This https://develop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001068527[guide] explains how to enable API access and configure password authentication. Once done, set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export ZENDESK_USERNAME=your-user-name
export ZENDESK_PASSWORD=your-password
export ZENDESK_SERVER_URL=your-unique-server-url
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
