== Camel Quarkus PubNub Integration Tests

By default the PubNub integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-pubnub` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a PubNub account https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup.

Then find your [test credentials] and set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export PUBNUB_PUBLISH_KEY=your-publish-key
export PUBNUB_SUBSCRIBE_KEY=your-subscribe-key
export PUBNUB_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, edit the `stubFor` blocks within the test case. You can capture recordings and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
