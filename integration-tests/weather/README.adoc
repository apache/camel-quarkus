== Camel Quarkus Weather Integration Tests

By default the Weather integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-weather` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a OpenWeather account https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.

Then find your API-key https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export WEATHER_API_ID=your-API-KEY
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
