== Camel Quarkus Slack Integration Tests

By default the Slack integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-Slack` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a Slack account and workspace https://slack.com/get-started#/create.

Create a channel named `test-channel`.

Youâ€™ll need to create a Slack app and use it on your workspace.

Use the 'User OAuth Token' as token for the producer and consumer endpoints. Set the corresponding scopes for Bot Token:

* `channels:history`
* `groups:history`
* `im:history`
* `mpim:history`
* `channels:read`
* `groups:read`
* `im:read`
* `mpim:read`
* `chat:write`

Install your app for the channel `test-channel`.

Add an `Incoming Webhook` for you app.

Invite the bot in the channel `test-channel`.

[source]
----
/invite @BOT_NAME

Next set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export SLACK_TOKEN=your-slack-token
export SLACK_SERVER_URL=https://slack.com
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/some/webhook/path
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
