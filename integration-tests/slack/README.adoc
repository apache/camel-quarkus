== Camel Quarkus Slack Integration Tests

By default the Slack integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-Slack` integration tests against the real API, you must first create a Slack account and workspace https://slack.com/get-started#/create.

Then configure Slack custom configurations for 'Incoming Webhooks' & the 'Slack API Tester' on your workspace.

Next set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export SLACK_TOKEN=your-slack-token
export SLACK_SERVER_URL=https://slack.com
export SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/some/webhook/path
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
