== Camel Quarkus Dropbox Integration Tests

To run the Dropbox integration tests, you need a valid Dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/developers[developer account]. Then from
the developer console, create a new app and make a note of the access token.

You will also require a refresh token for authentication. If you're planning on repeatedly performing tests, then it's a good idea to
generate a long-lived token. Some instructions for how to do that are here:

Then set the following environment variables. Note that `DROPBOX_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER` should be set to the name of your Dropbox app:

[source,shell]
----
export DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
export DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN=your-access-token-expiry
export DROPBOX_API_KEY=your-app-api-key
export DROPBOX_API_SECRET=your-app-api-secret
export DROPBOX_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER=your-client-identifier
export DROPBOX_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
----
