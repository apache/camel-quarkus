== Camel Quarkus Dropbox Integration Tests

To run the Dropbox integration tests, you need a valid Dropbox https://www.dropbox.com/developers[developer account]. Then from
the developer console, create a new app and make a note of the access token.

Then set the following environment variables. Note that `DROPBOX_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER` should be set to the name of your Dropbox app:

[source,shell]
----
export DROPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token
export DROPBOX_CLIENT_IDENTIFIER=your-client-identifier
----
