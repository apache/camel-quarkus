=== Splunk Web UI

The Splunk UI is helpful for the testing as you can see (and search) for data inside Splunk. The URL to the Splunk UI
is output to the console after the test container starts. Watch for the text 'Splunk UI running on'.

You may want to delay the Splunk container shutdown either by adding a `Thread.sleep` into `SplunkTestResource.stop()` or commenting out `container.stop()`.
