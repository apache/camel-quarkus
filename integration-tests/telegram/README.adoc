== Camel Quarkus Telegram Integration Tests

By default the Telegram integration tests use WireMock to stub the API interactions.

To run `camel-quarkus-telegram` integration tests against the real remote Telegram API, you must first create
a Telegram bot following this guide:
https://www.nicolaferraro.me/2016/05/27/creating-a-telegram-bot-in-5-minutes-with-apache-camel/

Then set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export TELEGRAM_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=my-authorization-token
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=my-chatId
export TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_EXTERNAL_URL=https://your-webhook-url
export TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN=my-webhook_authorization-token
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`

Note that you'll need 2 differents bots, one dedicated to the webhook consumer only.
