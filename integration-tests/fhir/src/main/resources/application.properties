# Quarkus :: Camel :: FHIR
#
# The HAPI-FHIR library, on which camel-fhir depends on, heavily uses reflection which affects performance in Quarkus
# (memory footprint, build time, CPU resources etc...). For the sake of time, only R5 is tested by default. To test
# additional FHIR versions, set the following configuration properties to true.
#
quarkus.camel.fhir.enable-dstu2=false
quarkus.camel.fhir.enable-dstu3=false
quarkus.camel.fhir.enable-r4=false
quarkus.camel.fhir.enable-r5=true
