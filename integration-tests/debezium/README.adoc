== MySQL

To run the MySQL Debezium integration tests you need to have `com.msql:mysql-connector-j` installed in you local `.m2` repository directory.
If it is not present, then you can https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/mysql/mysql-connector-j/[download] and https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html[install] it manually.

The path can be changed by adding `-Dmysql.driver.file=/path/to/mysql-connector-j.jar` to the command line.

== MS SQL Server

We cannot enable starting the container hosting the MS SQL test instance by default, because it requires expressing
consent with its EULA by placing a specific file on a specific location. The Apache Software Foundation's policy
prevents us of doing it unconditionally for anybody who clones this repository.

Therefore, to execute the MS SQL Server integration tests you need to accept the
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=857698[EULA] by creating file `integration-tests/debezium/src/test/resources/container-license-acceptance.txt` with content `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-CU12`
in the current Maven module.

On a Unix-like system, you can run.

[source,shell]
----
echo "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2017-CU12" > integration-tests/debezium/src/test/resources/container-license-acceptance.txt
