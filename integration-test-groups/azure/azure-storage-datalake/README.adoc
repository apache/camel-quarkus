There is no test container (nor Azurite), which supportd azure-storage-datalake.


=== Real Azure API

To run the tests against the real Azure API, you need to

* Export Your credentials (azure account key and account name)

[source,shell]
----
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<your-account-key>
export AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=<your-acount-name>
----

In case your need to use separate storage account to run storage tests and to run storage datalake tests:

Export Your credentials for *datalake* via specific variables

[source,shell]
----
export AZURE_STORAGE_DATALAKE_ACCOUNT_KEY=<your-account-key>
export AZURE_STORAGE_DATALAKE_ACCOUNT_NAME=<your-acount-name>
----
