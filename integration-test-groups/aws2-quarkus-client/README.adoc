= Camel Quarkus AWS 2 with Quarkus AWS 2 client extensions isolated integration tests

=== Localstack

The tests able to run against Localstack are run against Localstack by default.

The SES test is ignored unless `MAILSLURP_API_KEY` variable is set.

=== Real AWS API

To run the tests against the real AWS API, you need to

* Export Your
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys[AWS credentials]
  (access key ID and secret access key)
* Export our preferred
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions[AWS region].
* For SES, you additionally need a https://app.mailslurp.com/[MailSlurp account] and API key
  (the free dev account should be enough)

[source,shell]
----
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key-id>
export AWS_SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-access-key>
export AWS_REGION=eu-central-1
# for SES
export MAILSLURP_API_KEY=<your-mailslurp-api-key>

You may want to `export CAMEL_QUARKUS_START_MOCK_BACKEND=false` to force testing against
the real AWS API.
