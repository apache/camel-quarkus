= Quarkus CXF client tests

These are pure client tests - i.e. there are intentionally no services implemented in the test application.
All clients access services running in containers.

== Maintenenance notes

=== `CalculatorService.wsdl`

`src/main/resources/wsdl/CalculatorService.wsdl` is a static copy of the WSDL served by the testing container.
It would be too complicated to start the container before running the plugin, so we rather keep the static copy.

There is `org.apache.camel.quarkus.component.cxf.soap.it.CxfSoapClientTest.wsdlUpToDate()` to ensure that it is up to date.

To update `CalculatorService.wsdl` manually, first start the container

[shource,shell]
----
$ docker pull quay.io/l2x6/calculator-ws:1.0
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 quay.io/l2x6/calculator-ws:1.0
----

And then overwrite the existing file with the new content from the container:

[shource,shell]
----
curl "http://localhost:8080/calculator-ws/CalculatorService?wsdl" --output src/main/resources/wsdl/CalculatorService.wsdl
----
