= WS-Security and WS-SecurityPolicy tests

== WS-SecurityPolicy

We test in two ways how the SOAP service endpoints are deployed: the Camel way and the Quariverse CXF way.

=== The Camel way

* I.e. there is a Camel route with `from("cxf:...")`
* See `WsSecurityPolicyServerRoutes` and `WssSecurityPolicyHelloServiceImpl`

=== The Quariverse CXF way

* I.e. they are mapped to an URI path via Quariverse CXF settings in `application.properties`
* The service method then forwards to a Camel route defined in `WsSecurityPolicyServerRoutesCxfWay`
* See also `WssSecurityPolicyHelloServiceCxfWayImpl`
* This way may come in handy in situations when the Camel way does not work properly,
  such as https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/4291
