== Rotating secret on real account

To rotate secret on real account Lambda function has to be created at first.
The code which will create it for you in `AwsSecretsManagerTest#setupLambdaFunction` expects following:

* Created role (IAM -> Roles) with name `cq-lambda-role`.
* The role has to have atleast `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` and custom policy with:
```
			"Sid": "<unique-name>",
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"secretsmanager:DescribeSecret",
				"secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
				"secretsmanager:PutSecretValue",
				"secretsmanager:UpdateSecretVersionStage"
			],
			"Resource": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:<region>:<account-id>:secret:*"
		}
```
where

* `Sid` can be anything (eg. `CQSecretOperations`)
* `region` the same which you export with `AWS_REGION` env
* `account-id` can be found in the upper right corner in AWS Web UI
