=== Native mode `ObjectFactory` instantiation of non-JAXB annotated classes

When performing JAXB marshal operations with a custom `ObjectFactory` to instantiate POJO classes that do not have JAXB annotations,
you must register those POJO classes for reflection in order for them to be instantiated in native mode. E.g via the `@RegisterForReflection`
annotation or configuration property `quarkus.camel.native.reflection.include-patterns`.

Refer to the xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#reflection[Native mode] user guide for more information.
