For MLLP with TCP, Netty is the only supported means of running an Hl7 MLLP listener. Mina is not supported since it has no GraalVM native support at present.

Optional support for `HL7MLLPNettyEncoderFactory` & `HL7MLLPNettyDecoderFactory` codecs can be obtained by adding a dependency in your project `pom.xml` to `camel-quarkus-netty`.
