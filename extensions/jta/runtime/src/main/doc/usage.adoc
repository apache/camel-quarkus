This extension could be used when you need the `transacted()` in the router. It leverages the transaction capability provided by the narayana-jta extension in the Quarkus. 


Refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/transaction[Quarkus Transaction guide] for the more details about the transaction. For a simple usage:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:transaction")
    .transacted()
    .to("sql:INSERT INTO A TABLE ...?dataSource=ds1")
    .to("sql:INSERT INTO A TABLE ...?dataSource=ds2")
    .log("all data are in the ds1 and ds2")
----
