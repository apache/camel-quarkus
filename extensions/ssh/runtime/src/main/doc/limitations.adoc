=== Native mode limitations

==== EdDSA cipher on RHEL8 requires native image based on UBI8

Native image (based on UBI9 by default) requires `GLIBC 2.33`, which is not present on RHEL8.
Please use native image based on `ubi8` for the native build for RHEL8 to make EdDSA work in the native mode (for example `ubi-quarkus-mandrel-builder-image:jdk-21`).
