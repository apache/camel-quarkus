This extension leverages https://quarkus.io/guides/grpc-service-implementation[Quarkus gRPC]. The configuration of the gRPC consumer is different than normal,
since Quarkus manages the lifecycle of the gRPC server. This means that the consumer endpoint host and port is driven by the configuration properties `quarkus.grpc.server.host`
and `quarkus.grpc.server.port` and thus the Camel gRPC endpoint configuration for the host & port is effectively ignored. But, it's still good practice to have the
endpoint configuration host / port mirror the Quarkus gRPC host / port property values to avoid confusion and ambiguity.

The full list of Quarkus gRPC configuration options can be found at the https://quarkus.io/guides/grpc-service-implementation#server-configuration[Quarkus gRPC guide].
