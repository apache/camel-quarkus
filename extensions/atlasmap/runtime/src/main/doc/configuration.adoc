Note that you can perform mapping for these types of data:

* Java
* XML
* Json
* CSV

The _ADM archive file_ or _mapping definition JSON file_ used in the _AtlasMap route_ should be located in the _resources_ repository.
In native mode, include this file for native build. Example:
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = mapping/atlas-mapping.json
----

When mapping Java documents, you may need to register the corresponding Java classes for reflection.

You may want to check the https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/tree/main/integration-tests/atlasmap[integration test] in our source tree as an example.
