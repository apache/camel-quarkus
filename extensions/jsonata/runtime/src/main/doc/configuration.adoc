This component typically loads JSONata specifications from classpath.
To make it work also in native mode, you need to explicitly embed the specification files in the native executable
by using the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` property.

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").to("jsonata:spec/expressions.spec");
----

To include this (an possibly other specifications stored in `.spec` files) in the native image, you would have to add something like the following to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = spec/*.spec
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
