This component typically loads Flatpack mappings from classpath.
To make it work also in native mode, you need to explicitly embed the mappings in the native executable
by using the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` property.

For instance, the route below loads the Flatpack mappings from a classpath resource named `mappings/simple.pzmap.xml`:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").to("flatpack:delim:mappings/simple.pzmap.xml");
----

To include this (an possibly other mappings stored in `.pzmap.xml` files under the `mappings` directory) in the native image, you would have to add something like the following to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = mappings/*.pzmap.xml
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
