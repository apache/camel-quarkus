We cannot add the MySQL JDBC driver as a compile scope dependency of this extension because it is GPL2 licensed and it
would be against the policy of the Apache Software Foundation.

Therefore you have to add the dependency to your project yourself, as long as you are able to comply with its license
terms.

`quarkus-bom` (transitively included by `camel-quarkus-bom` and `quarkus-universe-bom`) manages a version
of `mysql:mysql-connector-java` compatible with Camel Quarkus. So you do not need specify the version of the
driver if you import any of the mentioned BOMs. The following should be sufficient for Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
</dependency>
----
