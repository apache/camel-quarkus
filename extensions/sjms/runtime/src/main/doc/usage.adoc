=== Message mapping with `org.w3c.dom.Node`

The Camel SJMS component supports message mapping between `javax.jms.Message` and `org.apache.camel.Message`. When wanting to convert a Camel message body type of `org.w3c.dom.Node`,
you must ensure that the `camel-quarkus-xml-jaxp` extension is present on the classpath.

=== Native mode support for javax.jms.ObjectMessage

When sending JMS message payloads as `javax.jms.ObjectMessage`, you must annotate the relevant classes to be registered for serialization with `@RegisterForReflection(serialization = true)`. 
Note that this extension automatically sets `quarkus.camel.native.reflection.serialization-enabled = true` for you. Refer to the xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#serialization[native mode user guide] for more information.
