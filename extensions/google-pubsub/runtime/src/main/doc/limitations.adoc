By default, the Camel PubSub component uses JDK object serialization via `ObjectOutputStream` whenever the message body is anything other than `String` or `byte[]`.

Since such serialization is not yet supported by GraalVM, this extension provides a custom Jackson based serializer to serialize complex message payloads as JSON.

If your payload contains binary data, then you will need to handle that by creating a custom Jackson Serializer / Deserializer. Refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-extensions#customizing-jackson[Quarkus Jackson guide] for 
information on how to do this.

Currently it needs a work around in native building to introduce a native-image.properties file containing the following line:
[source,properties]
----
Args = -H:+RunReachabilityHandlersConcurrently
----

Also this file needs to be in your application, e.g. `src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image/native-image.properties`
