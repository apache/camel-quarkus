When using camel-quarkus-bindy in native mode, only the build machine's default locale is supported.

For instance, on build machines with french default locale, the code below:
```
BindyDataFormat dataFormat = new BindyDataFormat();
dataFormat.setLocale("ar");
```
formats numbers the arabic way in JVM mode as expected. However, it formats numbers the french way in native mode.
