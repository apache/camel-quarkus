When using camel-quarkus-bindy in native mode, only the build machine's locale is supported.

For instance, on build machines with French locale, the code below:

[source,java]
----

BindyDataFormat dataFormat = new BindyDataFormat();
dataFormat.setLocale("ar");
----

formats numbers the arabic way in JVM mode as expected. However, it formats numbers the French way in native mode.

Without further tuning, the build machine's default locale would be used. Another locale can be specified with
the `quarkus.default-locale` configuration property.

For example, to make the above example work, the default locale could be set as follows.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.default-locale=ar-MA
----
