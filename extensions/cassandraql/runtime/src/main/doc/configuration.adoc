=== Cassandra aggregation repository in native mode

In order to use Cassandra aggregation repositories like `CassandraAggregationRepository` in native mode, you must xref:extensions/core.adoc#quarkus.camel.native.reflection.serialization-enabled[enable native serialization support].

In addition, if your exchange bodies are custom types, then they must be registered for serialization by annotating their class declaration with `@RegisterForReflection(serialization = true)`.
