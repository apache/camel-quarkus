=== Having only a single consumer in a cluster consuming from a given endpoint

When the same route is deployed on multiple pods, it could be interesting to use this extension in conjunction with the xref:reference/extensions/master.adoc[Master one].
In such a setup, a single consumer will be active at a time across the whole camel master namespace.

For instance, having the route below deployed on multiple pods:

```
from("master:ns:timer:test?period=100").log("Timer invoked on a single pod at a time");
```

As a result, a single consumer will be active across the `ns` camel master namespace.
It means that, at a given time, only a single timer will generate exchanges across the whole cluster.
In other words, messages will be logged every 100ms on a single pod at a time.

The kubernetes cluster service could further be tuned by tweaking `quarkus.camel.cluster.kubernetes.*` properties.
