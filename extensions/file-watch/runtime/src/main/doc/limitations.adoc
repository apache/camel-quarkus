The underlying Camel component configures the Directory Watcher in a platform specific way:

* On Mac, the `io.methvin.watchservice.MacOSXListeningWatchService` is used that depends on
  `https://github.com/java-native-access/jna[net.java.dev.jna:jna]`.
* Other platforms use `java.nio.file.WatchService` provided by the Java Runtime.

Because JNA is https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/673[not supported on GraalVM] yet, we made the component to behave differently on Camel Quarkus: We are substituting the respective Directory Watcher method do use the stock `java.nio.file.WatchService` also on Mac.
