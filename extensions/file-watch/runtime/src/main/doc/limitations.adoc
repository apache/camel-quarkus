=== macOS native mode limitations

Depending on the platform, the underlying Camel component configures the Directory Watcher differently in native mode.

On macOS, a `WatchService` implementation based on JNA is used to access native filesystem events. This provides better performance and scalability, compared to the JDK’s default macOS implementation.

Since JNA is not supported on GraalVM, `camel-quarkus-file-watch` cannot use the macOS-specific native `WatchService`. To maintain compatibility, the `WatchService` is forcefully overridden to `java.nio.file.WatchService`. This implementation may be slower compared to the JNA-based version.
