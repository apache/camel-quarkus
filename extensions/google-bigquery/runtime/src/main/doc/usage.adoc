If you want to read SQL scripts from the classpath with `google-bigquery-sql` in native mode,
then you will need to ensure that they are added to the native image via the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` configuration property.
Please check https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#quarkus-native-pkg-native-config_quarkus.native.resources.includes[Quarkus documentation] for more details.
