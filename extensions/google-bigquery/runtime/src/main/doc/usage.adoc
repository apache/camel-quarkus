This extension leverages the Quarkiverse Google Cloud Services extension.
The https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-google-cloud-services[documentation] describes how to configure authentication for Google cloud services.

For convenience, a `GoogleBigQueryConnectionFactory` for use by the `google-bigquery` & `google-bigquery-sql` component is automatically configured.

If you want to read SQL scripts from the classpath with `google-bigquery-sql` in native mode,
then you will need to ensure that they are added to the native image via the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` configuration property.
Please check https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#quarkus-native-pkg-native-config_quarkus.native.resources.includes[Quarkus documentation] for more details.
