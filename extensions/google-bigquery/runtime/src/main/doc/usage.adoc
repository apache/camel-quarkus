This extension leverages the Quarkiverse Google Cloud Services extension. The https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-google-cloud-services[documentation] describes
how to configure authentication for Google cloud services.

For convenience, a `GoogleBigQueryConnectionFactory` for use by the `google-bigquery` & `google-bigquery-sql` component is automatically configured.

If you want to read SQL scripts from the classpath with `google-bigquery-sql` in native mode, then you will need to ensure that they are added to the native image via
the `quarkus.camel.native.resources.include-patterns` configuration property.
