This extension leverages https://github.com/hazelcast/quarkus-hazelcast-client[Hazelcast Client for Quarkus]. The configuration of the HazelcastInstance is managed by the extension. To configure Hazelcast Instance, check the https://github.com/hazelcast/quarkus-hazelcast-client[Hazelcast Client for Quarkus] guide.

*Please note that the camel-quarkus-hazelcast component works only with the client mode.*

To use the Hazelcast instance in the camel-quarkus-hazelcast component, you should configure the component with :

* The HazelcastInstance initialized by the Hazelcast Client for Quarkus
* The component mode as : "client"

Example of configuration for HazelcastMap component:

[source,java]
----
    @Inject
    HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;

    @Produces
    @ApplicationScoped
    @Unremovable
    @Named("hazelcast-map")
    HazelcastDefaultComponent hazelcastMap() {
        final HazelcastMapComponent hazelcastComponent = new HazelcastMapComponent();
        hazelcastComponent.setHazelcastInstance(hazelcastInstance);
        hazelcastComponent.setHazelcastMode(HazelcastConstants.HAZELCAST_CLIENT_MODE);
        return getHazelcastComponent(hazelcastComponent);
    }
