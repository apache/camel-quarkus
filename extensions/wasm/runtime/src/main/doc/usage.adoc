== Reading Wasm modules from the classpath in native mode

When Wasm modules are read from the classpath (the default) in native mode, you must ensure that the module(s) are added to the native image.
You can do this via a configuration property in `application.properties`.

For example, assuming `.wasm` files are read from a classpath location of `was/modules`.

[source,properties]

quarkus.native.resources.includes = wasm/modules/*.wasm

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found in the xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[native mode user guide].
