This extension leverages https://www.smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/[SmallRye Reactive Messaging].
Examples for how to use the Camel connector are outlined within the https://www.smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/[documentation].
Note that where the documentation makes references to Camel component maven dependencies, you should ensure that the corresponding camel-quarkus extension is used.
E.g `<artifactId>camel-file</artifactId>` should be `<artifactId>camel-quarkus-file</artifactId>`.
