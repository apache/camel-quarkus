While you can use any of the available Kafka offset stores in JVM mode, only the following offset stores are supported
in native mode:

* `org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore`
* `org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.MemoryOffsetBackingStore`

Please file an https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/new[issue] if you are missing some specific offset store
in native mode.
