=== Pre-load Kamelets at build-time

This extension allow to pre-load a set of Kamelets at build time through the following two options. The kamelet to pre-load can be listed using the `quarkus.camel.kamelet.names` property.

=== Using the Kamelet Catalog

//TODO: does not yet exist

A set of pre-made Kamelets can be found on the https://camel.apache.org/camel-kamelets/latest[Kamelet Catalog].
To use the Kamelet from the catalog you either need to copy them on your project in the classpath location defined by the `quarkus.camel.kamelet.location` property, or you can add the `camel-quarkus-kamelets-catalog` artifact to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-kamelets-catalog</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This artifact makes all the kamelets available in the catalog available to Camel Quarkus for build time processing, the artefact is not part of the runtime classpath.
