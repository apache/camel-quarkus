=== Preloading Kamelets at build-time

This extension can preload a set of Kamelets at build time. You must include the names of each Kamelet, in the `quarkus.camel.kamelet.identifiers` configuration property.

=== Using the Kamelet Catalog

A set of pre-made Kamelets can be found in the Kamelet Catalog.
To use a Kamelet from the catalog, you need to copy its YAML definition (that you can find https://github.com/apache/camel-kamelets/[in the camel-kamelets repository]) to your project.

Alternatively, you can add the `camel-kamelets` dependency to your application.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.kamelets</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-kamelets</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

You can select which Kamelets from the catalog you want to use by referencing their name in the `quarkus.camel.kamelet.identifiers` property.
