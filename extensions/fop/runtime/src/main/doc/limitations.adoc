While you can use any of the available output types in JVM mode, only PDF output type is supported
in native mode. PDF output type in native mode has several limitations:

* Default sRGB color space is always disabled because of https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/2850[Graal VM issue #2850]
and `disable-srgb-colorspace` https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/2.1/configuration.html[FOP configuration property] is
ignored.

* If custom fonts are used, font cache has to be disabled because of https://github.com/oracle/graal/issues/460[Graal VM issue #460].
Please set the https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/2.1/configuration.html[FOP configuration property] `use-cache` to `false`.

Please file an https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/new[issue] if you are missing some specific output format
in native mode.
