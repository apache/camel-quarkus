=== Supported JDK versions

Due to an https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-3275[issue] with Apache FOP encountered with JDK 25, it's advised to build and run your application with JDK 21 or JDK 17 when using this extension.

When running in native mode, you'll need to ensure you build with the appropriate GraalVM / Mandrel version. When using containerized native image builds, you can override the default Quarkus builder image with the following configuration.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi9-quarkus-mandrel-builder-image:jdk-21
----

=== Supported Output Types

While you can use any of the available output types in JVM mode, only PDF output type is supported
in native mode.

Please file an https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/new[issue] if you are missing some specific output format
in native mode.
