=== Custom ISO-8583 parser configurations in native mode

If you choose to use a configuration file named differently to the default `j8583-config.xml`, then you must register this file as a native image resource.

For example.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = my-custom-config.xml
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
