=== Optional integration with Quarkus Amazon DynamoDB

If desired, it is possible to use the Quarkus Amazon DynamoDB Client extension in conjunction with Camel Quarkus AWS2 DDB.
Note that this optional and not at all mandatory.
Follow the https://quarkus.io/guides/amazon-dynamodb#configuring-dynamodb-clients[documentation] with some caveats.

1. The Apache client type has to be selected by configuring the following property.
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.dynamodb.sync-client.type=apache
----

2. The `DynamoDbClient` has to be injected somewhere in the application. This triggers its creation so that the Camel component can discover it.
+
[source,java]
----
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.dynamodb.DynamoDbClient;

@Inject
DynamoDbClient dynamoDB;
----
