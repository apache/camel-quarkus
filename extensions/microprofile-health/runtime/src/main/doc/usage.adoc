You can register health checks for your applications with the https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/health-check.html[Camel health check API].

By default, classes extending `AbstractHealthCheck` are registered as both liveness and readiness checks. For finer control over whether
a check is registered as a liveness or readiness check, you can extend either `AbstractCamelMicroProfileLivenessCheck` or `AbstractCamelMicroProfileReadinessCheck`.

Any checks provided by your application are automatically discovered and bound to the Camel registry. They will be available via
the Quarkus health endpoints `/health/live` and `/health/ready`.

You can also provide custom `HealthCheckRepository` implementations and these are also automatically discovered and bound to the Camel registry for you.

Refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/health-guide[Quarkus health guide] for further information.

=== Provided health checks

Some checks are automatically registered for your application.

==== Camel Context Health

Inspects the Camel Context status and causes the health check status to be `DOWN` if the status is anything other than 'Started'.

==== Camel Route Health

Inspects the status of each route and causes the health check status to be `DOWN` if any route status is not 'Started'.
