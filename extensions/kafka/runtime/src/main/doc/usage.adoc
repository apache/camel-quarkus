=== Quarkus Kafka Dev Services

Camel Quarkus Kafka can take advantage of https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-dev-services[Quarkus Kafka Dev services] to simplify development and testing with a local containerized Kafka broker.

Kafka Dev Services is enabled by default in dev & test mode.
The Camel Kafka component is automatically configured so that the `brokers` component option is set to point at the local containerized Kafka broker.
Meaning that there's no need to configure this option yourself.

This functionality can be disabled with the configuration property `quarkus.kafka.devservices.enabled=false`.
