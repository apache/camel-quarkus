=== Native mode

JMX in GraalVM is still *experimental*. Therefore, some features are not available in native mode.

* Operations for MBean `java.lang:type=Threading` are not fully implemented. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain details about application threads.
* Various MBean attributes do not have their values implemented. For example, the `ClassCount` attribute values for MBean `java.lang:type=ClassLoading` are fixed at `0`
