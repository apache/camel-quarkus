You can use this extension to expose REST DSL services to Quarkus OpenAPI. With
`quarkus-smallrye-openapi`, you can access them by `/q/openapi?format=json`.

Refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/openapi-swaggerui[Quarkus OpenAPI guide] for further information.

This is an experimental feature. You can enable it by
[source, properties]

[WARNING]
====
It doesn't support the rest services used in `org.apache.camel.builder.LambdaRouteBuilder` right now.
Also, it can not use CDI injection in the RouteBuilder `configure()` since we get the rest definitions at build time while CDI is unavailable.
