Due to some limitations in GraalVM that prevent to execute even basic scripts in native mode, the compilation of the
Groovy expressions is made with the static compilation enabled which means that the types used in your expression must
be known at compile time. Please refer to the https://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/core-semantics.html#static-type-checking[Groovy documentation for more details].
