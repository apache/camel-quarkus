CDI producer methods can be harnessed to bind endpoints to the Camel registry, so that they can be resolved
using the `ref` URI scheme in Camel routes.

For example, to produce endpoint beans:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyEndpointProducers {
    @Inject
    CamelContext context;

    @Singleton
    @Produces
    @Named("endpoint1")
    public Endpoint directStart() {
        return context.getEndpoint("direct:start");
    }

    @Singleton
    @Produces
    @Named("endpoint2")
    public Endpoint logEnd() {
        return context.getEndpoint("log:end");
    }
}
----

Use `ref:` to refer to the names of the CDI beans that were bound to the Camel registry:

[source,java]
----
public class MyRefRoutes extends RouteBuilder {
    @Override
    public void configure() {
        // direct:start -> log:end
        from("ref:endpoint1")
            .to("ref:endpoint2");
    }
}
----
