The extension leverages the https://github.com/amqphub/quarkus-qpid-jms/[Quarkus Qpid JMS] extension. A ConnectionFactory bean is automatically created
and wired into the AMQP component for you. The connection factory can be configured
via the Quarkus Qpid JMS https://github.com/amqphub/quarkus-qpid-jms#configuration[configuration options].
