=== Optional integration with Quarkus Amazon S3

If desired, it is possible to use the Quarkus Amazon S3 Client extension in conjunction with Camel Quarkus AWS2 S3.
Note that this optional and not at all mandatory.
Follow the https://quarkus.io/guides/amazon-s3#configuring-s3-clients[documentation] with some caveats.

1. The Apache client type has to be selected by configuring the following property.
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.s3.sync-client.type=apache
----

2. The `S3Client` has to be injected somewhere in the application. This triggers its creation so that the Camel component can discover it.
+
[source,java]
----
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3Client;

@Inject
S3Client s3Client;
----
