=== Optional integration with Quarkus Amazon S3

If desired, it is possible to use the Quarkus Amazon S3 Client extension in conjunction with Camel Quarkus AWS2 S3.
Note that this is fully optional and not at all mandatory.
Follow the https://quarkus.io/guides/amazon-s3#configuring-s3-clients[Quarkus documentation] with some caveats.

1. The Apache client type has to be selected by configuring the following property.
+
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.s3.sync-client.type=apache
----

2. The `S3Client` has to be "unremovable" in the sense of https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference#remove_unused_beans[Quarkus CDI reference] so that Camel Quarkus is able to look it up at runtime.
You can reach that e.g. by adding a dummy bean injecting `S3Client`:
+
[source,java]
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import io.quarkus.arc.Unremovable;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3Client;

@ApplicationScoped
@Unremovable
class UnremovableS3Client {
    @Inject
    S3Client s3Client;
}
----
