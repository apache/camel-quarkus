This component typically loads Mustache templates from classpath.
To make it work also in native mode, you need to explicitly embed the templates in the native executable
by using the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` property.

For instance, the route below would load the Mustache template from a classpath resource named `template/simple.mustache`:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").to("mustache://template/simple.mustache");
----

To include this (an possibly other templates stored in `.mustache` files) in the native image, you would have to add something like the following to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = template/*.mustache
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
