# Disable CDI bean injection for Keycloak Admin Client
# The camel-keycloak component creates its own Keycloak client instances dynamically
# based on endpoint configuration, so the injected bean would not be used and could
# cause conflicts. The quarkus-keycloak-admin-resteasy-client extension is only used
# for its native mode support.
