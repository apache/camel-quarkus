### Starting flight recording

To enable Java Flight Recorder to start a recording and automatically dump the recording to disk after Camel startup is complete, use the following configuration in `application.properties`.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.camel.jfr.startup-recorder-recording=true
----

Alternatively you can pass some Java options to the runnable application JAR or the native executable to enable flight recording at application startup.

In JVM mode the application runnable JAR can be executed as follows.

[source,shell]
----
$ java -XX:+FlightRecorder -XX:StartFlightRecording=filename=recording.jfr -jar quarkus-run.jar
----

In native mode, the native executable can be executed as follows.

[source,shell]
----
$ ./my-application-runner -XX:+FlightRecorder -XX:StartFlightRecording=filename=recording.jfr
----

### Flight recording in native mode

To build a native image with Java Flight Recorder support, it is mandatory to enable VM inspection via the following configuration property in `application.properties`.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.enable-vm-inspection=true
----
