The Groovy extensions are not supported which means that the extensions defined in the Camel project are ignored, more details in https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/4384[Groovy DSL - Add support of Groovy extensions issue #4384].

In case of native compilation, for some specific use cases like the following one, it could be needed to add the flag `--report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime` to prevent compilation error of type `DeletedElementException: Unsupported method java.lang.Class.registerNatives() is reachable`.

[source,groovy]
----
import org.apache.camel.component.seda.SedaComponent

camel {
    components {
        mySeda(SedaComponent) { // <1>
            // rest of the closure here
        }
    }
}
// rest of the Groovy script
----
<1> Requires the flag `--report-unsupported-elements-at-runtime` to be added to the build command for native compilation.
