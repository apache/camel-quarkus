=== Required Dependencies

The Language extension only handles the passing of an Exchange to a script for execution. The extension implementing the language must be added as a dependency. The following list of languages are implemented in xref:reference/extensions/core.adoc[Core]:

* Constant
* ExchangeProperty
* File
* Header
* Ref
* Simple
* Tokenize

To use any other language, you must add the corresponding dependency. Consult the xref:reference/languages.adoc[Languages Guide] for details.

=== Native Mode

When loading scripts from the classpath in native mode, the path to the script file must be specified in the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` property of the `application.properties` file. For example:

[source]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes=script.txt
----
