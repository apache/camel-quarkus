=== Using SSL in Native Mode

When using a custom `SSLSocketFactory` in native mode, such as the one in the xref:{cq-camel-components}::ldap-component.adoc#_configuring_ssl[Configuring SSL] section, you need to register the class for reflection otherwise the class will not be made available on the classpath. Add the `@RegisterForReflection` annotation above the class definition, as follows:

[source,java]
----
@RegisterForReflection
public class CustomSSLSocketFactory extends SSLSocketFactory {
    // The class definition is the same as in the above link. 
}
----
