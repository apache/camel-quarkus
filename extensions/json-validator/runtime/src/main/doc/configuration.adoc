This component typically loads JSON schemas from classpath.
To make it work also in native mode, you need to explicitly embed the schema files in the native executable
by using the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` property.

For instance, the route below would load the schema from a classpath resource named `schema.json`:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").to("json-validator:schema.json");
----

To include this (an possibly other schemas stored in `.json` files) in the native image, you would have to add something like the following to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = schema.json
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
