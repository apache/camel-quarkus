== What is this

This project hosts the efforts to port and package the 280+ Camel components as Quarkus extensions.

http://camel.apache.org/[Apache Camel] is the Swiss knife of integrating heterogeneous systems with more than a decade
of history and a lively community of users and developers.

https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] is a Java platform offering fast boot times and low memory footprint. It targets both stock
JVMs (OpenJDK in the first place) and https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM].

https://quarkus.io/extensions/[Quarkus extensions] are units of Quarkus distribution. They configure, boot and integrate
a technology (in our case Camel components) into your Quarkus application. You will typically use them as dependencies
in your project.


== How to build

See the contributor guide xref:docs/modules/ROOT/pages/contributor-guide.adoc[in the source tree] or on the
