=== CSimple language

CSimple language is supported only in

* XML DSL
* Java DSL when implemented in a class extending `org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder`

The compilation of CSimple scripts happens at build time. To extract the scripts from the route definitions, these need
to be assembled at build time. This may fail if the given route requires some data that is only available at runtime.
You can use the `quarkus.camel.csimple.on-build-time-analysis-failure` configuration parameter to decide
what should happen in such cases. The possible values are `warn` (default), `fail` or `ignore`.

[WARNING]
====
CSimple language will not work on Camel Quarkus if used in a `org.apache.camel.builder.LambdaRouteBuilder`
