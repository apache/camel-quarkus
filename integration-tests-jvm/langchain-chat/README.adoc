== Camel Quarkus Langchain4j Chat Integration Tests

By default, the Langchain4j-chat integration tests use WireMock to stub Ollama API interactions.

To run the `camel-quarkus-langchain4j-chat` integration tests against the real API, you need a Ollama instance running with the `orca-mini` model downloaded.

When Ollama is running, set the following environment variables:

[source,shell]
----
export OLLAMA_URL=your-ollama-api-url
----

If the WireMock stub recordings need updating, then remove the existing files from `src/test/resources/mappings` and run tests with either:

System property `-Dwiremock.record=true`

Or

Set environment variable `WIREMOCK_RECORD=true`
