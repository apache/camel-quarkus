= timer-log

This is a basic hello world example that uses a Camel timer that
triggers every second and prints to the log.

To run it:

[source,text]
----
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev -DnoDeps
----

Then look at the log output in the console. As we run the example
in Quarkus Dev Mode, you can edit the source code and have live updates.
For example try to change the logging output to be `Bye World`.

== Native build

To build as native:

[source,text]
----
$ mvn package -Pnative-image
----

This requires having GraalVM and other tools installed.
See the https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide[Quarkus Native Guide] for details.
