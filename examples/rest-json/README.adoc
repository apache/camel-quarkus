This example is a port of Quarkus' quickstart https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-quickstarts/blob/master/rest-json[rest-json] to Camel.

TIP: Check the https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/first-steps.html[Camel Quarkus User guide] for prerequisites
and other general information.

== Start in the Development mode

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean compile quarkus:dev -DnoDeps
----

The above command compiles the project, starts the application and lets the Quarkus tooling watch for changes in your
workspace. Any modifications in your project will automatically take effect in the running application.

TIP: Please refer to the Development mode section of
https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/first-steps.html#_development_mode[Camel Quarkus User guide] for more details.

Then point your browser to one of the endpoints:

* http://localhost:8080/fruits
* http://localhost:8080/legumes

=== Package and run the application

Once you are done with developing you may want to package and run the application.

TIP: Find more details about the JVM mode and Native mode in the Package and run section of
https://camel.apache.org/camel-quarkus/latest/first-steps.html#_package_and_run_the_application[Camel Quarkus User guide]

==== JVM mode

[source,shell]
