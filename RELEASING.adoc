= Apache Camel Quarkus release process

The process is _mutatis mutandis_ the same as for the main Apache Camel repository - see
https://camel.apache.org/release-guide.html

In addition to the above, the following steps are needed:

* After releasing the staging repository on https://oss.sonatype.org, update the value of `camel-quarkus-last-release`
attribute in https://github.com/apache/camel-website/blob/master/site.yml#L36[site.yml of `camel-website`] and in
https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/master/docs/site.yml#L19[site.yml of `camel-quarkus`].
