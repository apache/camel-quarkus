=== Developer console endpoint

To access the developer console, you must first enable it by adding configuration to `application.properties`.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.camel.console.enabled=true
----

Alternatively you can use a `camel-main` configuration option.

[source,properties]
----
camel.main.dev-console-enabled=true
----

The console is then available at the following URL.

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/q/camel/dev-console
----

You can then call a console by its id, such as `routes`:

[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/q/camel/dev-console/routes
----

=== Exposing the developer console in prod mode

By default, the console is only exposed in dev and test modes. To expose the console in prod mode, add the following configuration to `application.properties`.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.camel.console.exposure-mode=ALL
----

See the configuration overview below for further details about `exposure-mode`.
