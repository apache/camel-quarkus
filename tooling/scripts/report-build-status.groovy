/**
 * A script to report on the build status of synchronization for branches camel-main and quarkus-main.
 *
 * A GitHub issue ID is passed to this script from the GitHub workflow. The issue is intended to be repeatedly closed / reopened
 * whenever a build workflow run is successful / unsuccessful.
 *
 * If failures were encountered in the build, a comment is appended to a specified GitHub issue, with the body containing
 * information about the commit SHA and a link to the build.
 *
 * If the build was successful, the open GitHub issue relating to the branch build will be closed.
 *
 * The script also outputs a GitHub action step variable named 'overall_build_status', this is used by the build to determine whether it
 * should automatically merge the latest changes from the main branch, to the target branch.
