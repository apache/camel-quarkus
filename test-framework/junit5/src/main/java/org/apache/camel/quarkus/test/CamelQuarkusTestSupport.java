/**
 * The {@link CamelTestSupport} class does not work on Quarkus. This class provides a replacement, which can be used in
 * JVM mode. There are several differences between {@link CamelTestSupport} and this class.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Starting and stopping {@link CamelContext} in Camel Quarkus is generally bound to starting and stopping the
 * application
 * and this holds also when testing.</li>
 * <li>Starting and stopping the application under test (and thus also {@link CamelContext} is under full control of
 * Quarkus
 * JUnit Extension. It prefers keeping the application up and running unless it is told to do otherwise.</li>
 * <li>Hence normally the application under test is started only once for all test classes of the given Maven/Gradle
 * module.</li>
 * <li>To force Quarkus JUnit Extension to restart the application (and thus also `CamelContext`) for a given test
 * class, you need to assign a unique {@code @io.quarkus.test.junit.TestProfile} to that class. Check the
 * <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#testing_different_profiles">Quarkus documentation</a> for
 * how you can do
 * that. (Note that
 * <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#quarkus-test-resource">QuarkusTestResource</a>
 * has a similar effect.)</li>
 * <li>Camel Quarkus executes the production of beans during the build phase. Because all the tests are
 * build together, exclusion behavior is implemented into {@link CamelQuarkusTestSupport}. If a producer of the specific
 * type
 * and name is used in one tests, the instance will be the same for the rest of the tests.</li>
 * <li>JUnit Jupiter callbacks {@code BeforeEachCallback}, {@code AfterEachCallback}, {@code AfterAllCallback},
 * {@code BeforeAllCallback},
 * {@code BeforeTestExecutionCallback} and {@code AfterTestExecutionCallback}) might not work correctly. See the
 * <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/getting-started-testing#enrichment-via-quarkustestcallback">documentation</a>.
 * Methods {@code afterAll}, {@code afterEach}, {@code afterTestExecution}, {@code beforeAll} and {@code beforeEach} are
 * not executed anymore.
 * You should use {@code doAfterAll}, {@code doAfterConstruct}, {@code doAfterEach}, {@code doBeforeEach} and
 * {@code doBeforeAll} instead of
 * them.</li>
 * </ul>
