= Configuration
:page-aliases: user-guide/bootstrap.adoc

Camel Quarkus automatically configures and deploys a Camel Context bean which by default is started/stopped according to
the Quarkus Application lifecycle. The configuration step happens at build time during Quarkus' augmentation phase and
it is driven by the Camel Quarkus extensions which can be tuned using Camel Quarkus specific `quarkus.camel.*`
properties.

[INFO]
====
`quarkus.camel.*` configuration properties are documented on the individual extension pages
- see e.g. xref:reference/extensions/core.adoc[Camel Quarkus Core].
====

After the configuration is done, a minimal Camel Runtime is assembled and started in the
https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-extensions#bootstrap-three-phases[RUNTIME_INIT] phase.


== Configuring Camel components

=== `application.properties`

To configure components and other aspects of Apache Camel through properties,
make sure that your application depends on `camel-quarkus-core` directly or transitively.
Because most Camel Quarkus extensions depend on `camel-quarkus-core`, you typically do not need to add it explicitly.

`camel-quarkus-core` brings functionalities from xref:{cq-camel-components}:others:main.adoc[Camel
Main] to Camel Quarkus.

In the example below, we set a specific `ExchangeFormatter` configuration on the `LogComponent` via
`application.properties`:

[source,properties]
----
camel.component.log.exchange-formatter = #class:org.apache.camel.support.processor.DefaultExchangeFormatter
camel.component.log.exchange-formatter.show-exchange-pattern = false
camel.component.log.exchange-formatter.show-body-type = false
----


=== CDI

The same can be done programmatically using CDI:

[source,java]
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.inject.Named;

import org.apache.camel.component.log.LogComponent;
import org.apache.camel.support.processor.DefaultExchangeFormatter;

@ApplicationScoped
public class Configurations {
    /**
     * Produces a {@link LogComponent} instance with a custom exchange formatter set-up.
     */
    @Named("log") // <1>
    LogComponent log() {
        DefaultExchangeFormatter formatter = new DefaultExchangeFormatter();
        formatter.setShowExchangePattern(false);
        formatter.setShowBodyType(false);

        LogComponent component = new LogComponent();
        component.setExchangeFormatter(formatter);

        return component;
    }
}
----
<1> Camel uses the component URI scheme to look-up components from its registry, this requires you to add the `@Named` annotation to the method, otherwise the CDI container would create an anonymous bean and Camel would not be able to look it up.
The `"log"` argument of the `@Named` annotation can be omitted as long as the name of the method is the same.

In Camel Quarkus, the Camel components are discovered during the augmentation phase.
Hence producing a new component as shown in the example above would invalidate any optimization that may have been made.

As a better alternative you can use `@Inject` to obtain an instance of a component automatically created by Camel or you can observe one of the https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/tree/main/extensions-core/core/runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/quarkus/core/events[events] fired by Camel Quarkus as shown in the following example, in which we use `@Observes` to be notified about components added to the Camel Context:

[source,java]
----
import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.enterprise.event.Observes;
import org.apache.camel.quarkus.core.events.ComponentAddEvent;
import org.apache.camel.component.log.LogComponent;

@ApplicationScoped
public static class EventHandler {
    public void onComponentAdd(@Observes ComponentAddEvent event) {
        if (event.getComponent() instanceof LogComponent) {
            // do something with the log component
        }
    }
}
----

== Camel Quarkus Core and Camel Main

INFO: Before Camel Quarkus 1.8.0, `camel-quarkus-main` used to be a separate artifact.
Since 1.8.0, all its functionality moved to `camel-quarkus-core`.

== Configuration by convention

In addition to support configuring Camel through properties, `camel-quarkus-core` allows you to use conventions to configure the Camel behavior.
For example, if there is a single `ExchangeFormatter` instance in the CDI container, then it will automatically wire that bean to the `LogComponent`.

== What's next?

We recommend to continue with xref:user-guide/cdi.adoc[CDI].
