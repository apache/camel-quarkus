== Health & liveness checks

Health & liveness checks are supported via the
xref:reference/extensions/microprofile-health.adoc[MicroProfile Health] extension. They can be configured via the
xref:manual::health-check.adoc[Camel Health] API or via
https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile-health[Quarkus MicroProfile Health].

All configured checks are available on the standard MicroProfile Health endpoint URLs:

* http://localhost:8080/q/health
* http://localhost:8080/q/health/live
* http://localhost:8080/q/health/ready

There's an example project which demonstrates health checks: https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus-examples/tree/main/health

Note that the `/q` path prefix was added in Camel Quarkus 2.0.0. Refer to the xref:migration-guide/2.0.0.adoc[migration guide] for more information.

== Metrics

Metrics are provided by the xref:reference/extensions/micrometer.adoc[Micrometer] extension which integrates with https://quarkus.io/guides/micrometer[Quarkus Micrometer].

Some basic Camel metrics are provided for you out of the box, and these can be supplemented by configuring additional metrics in your routes.

Metrics are available on the standard Quarkus metrics endpoint:

* http://localhost:8080/q/metrics

== Tracing

xref:reference/extensions/opentelemetry.adoc[Camel Quarkus OpenTelemetry extension] integrates with the
https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry[Quarkus OpenTelemetry extension]. All you need to do is set up the required
https://quarkus.io/guides/opentelemetry#create-the-configuration[configuration] properties and an `OpenTelemetryTracer`
will get automatically added to the registry for Camel to use.

There's an example project demonstrating the above features here:
https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus-examples/tree/main/observability
