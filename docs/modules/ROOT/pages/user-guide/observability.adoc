== Health & liveness checks

Health & liveness checks are supported via the
xref:reference/extensions/microprofile-health.html[MicroProfile Health] extension. They can be configured via the
https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/health-check.html[Camel Health] API or via
https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile-health[Quarkus MicroProfile Health].

All configured checks are available on the standard MicroProfile Health endpoint URLs:

* http://localhost:8080/health
* http://localhost:8080/health/live
* http://localhost:8080/health/ready

There's an example project which demonstrates health checks: https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/tree/master/examples/health

== Metrics

We provide the xref:reference/extensions/microprofile-metrics.html[MicroProfile Metrics] extension which integrates with
https://quarkus.io/guides/microprofile-metrics[Quarkus MicroProfile Metrics] under the hood. Some basic Camel metrics
are provided for you out of the box, and these can be supplemented by configuring additional metrics in your routes.

Metrics are available on the standard MicroProfile metrics endpoint:

* http://localhost:8080/metrics

== Tracing

xref:reference/extensions/opentracing.html[Camel Quarkus OpenTracing extension] integrates with the
https://quarkus.io/guides/opentracing[Quarkus OpenTracing extension]. All you need to do is set up the required
https://quarkus.io/guides/opentracing#create-the-configuration[configuration] properties and an `OpenTracingTracer`
will get automatically added to the registry for Camel to use.

There's an example project demonstrating the above features here:
https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/tree/master/examples/observability
