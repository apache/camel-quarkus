= Apache Camel extensions for Quarkus

This project aims to bring the awesome integration capabilities of https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/[Apache Camel]
and its vast https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/[component library] to the
https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus runtime].

This enables users to take advantage of the performance benefits, https://quarkus.io/vision/developer-joy[developer joy]
and the https://quarkus.io/vision/container-first[container first ethos] that Quarkus provides.

Camel Quarkus provides xref:reference/index.adoc[Quarkus extensions] for many of the Camel components.

Camel Quarkus also takes advantage of the many performance improvements made in Camel 3, which results in a lower memory footprint, less reliance on reflection (which is good for native application support) and faster startup times.

You can define Camel routes using the Java DSL, XML & Kotlin (see the xref:user-guide/examples.adoc[examples]).
