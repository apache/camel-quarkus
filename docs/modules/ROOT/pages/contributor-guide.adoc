[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* `git`
* GraalVM with `native-image` command installed and `GRAALVM_HOME` environment variable set, see
  https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide[Building a native executable] section of the Quarkus
  documentation.
* If your are on Linux, `docker` is sufficient for the native mode too. Use `-Pnative,docker` instead of `-Pnative`
  if you choose this option.
* Java 8
* Maven 3.6.2+ (unless you use the Maven Wrapper, a.k.a. `mvnw` available in the source tree).
