= Camel Quarkus 2.11.0 Migration Guide

The following guide outlines how to adapt your code to changes that were made in Camel Quarkus 2.11.0 & Quarkus 2.11.0.Final.

== Changes to Quartz clustering support

In previous releases the Camel Quarkus Quartz documentation listed various means of configuring Quartz for clustering. This has now been simplified
to a single set of instructions that leverages Quarkus Quartz. If you are using one of the previous methods of clustering, it is advised to update your 
application to the new method documented in the xref:reference/extensions/quartz.adoc[Quartz extension guide].
