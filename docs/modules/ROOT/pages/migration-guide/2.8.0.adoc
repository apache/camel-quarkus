= Camel Quarkus 2.8.0 Migration Guide

The following guide outlines how to adapt your code to changes that were made in Camel Quarkus 2.8.0 & Quarkus 2.8.0.Final.

== Change to default values of `quarkus.camel.fhir.enable` configuration

In previous releases, the FHIR extension default was to enable support for all FHIR versions.

This has now changed. Only the FHIR version that the Camel FHIR component and DataFormat use by default are enabled (R4).

To enable or disable support for the various FHIR versions, you can add some configuration properties to `application.properties`. For example.

```
quarkus.camel.fhir.enable-dstu2=true
quarkus.camel.fhir.enable-r4=false
```

For more information, refer to the xref:reference/extensions/fhir.adoc[Camel Quarkus FHIR Extension] documentation.

== Removal of the weka and ipfs extensions

The weka and ipfs extensions have been removed from this release because of issues related to the build infrastructure.
Volunteers wishing to maintain those projects are welcome.
