= Camel Quarkus 3.18.0 Migration Guide

The following guide outlines how to adapt your code to changes that were made in Camel Quarkus 3.18.0.

== `camel-quarkus-yaml-dsl` is now required when using Kamelets with the Java DSL

When using Kamelets in conjunction with Java DSL routes, you must ensure `camel-quarkus-yaml-dsl` is added to the project dependencies.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-yaml-dsl</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Failing to do this will result in a runtime exception like the following.

[source,shell]
----
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot find RoutesBuilderLoader in classpath supporting file extension: kamelet.yaml
----

TIP: You can create Kamelets using Camel JBang, export them to a Camel Quarkus application and `camel-quarkus-yaml-dsl` will be added automatically.
