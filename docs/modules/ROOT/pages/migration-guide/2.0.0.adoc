# Camel Quarkus 2.0.0 Migration Guide

The following guide outlines how to adapt your code to changes that were made in Camel Quarkus 2.0.0 & Quarkus 2.0.0.Final.

## Changes to the observability HTTP endpoint paths

In Quarkus 1.x, health and metrics endpoints were available at `/metrics` & `/health` context paths. In Quarkus 2.x this has changed with the addition of a mandatory `/q` path prefix. The endpoints are 
now accessible at the following URLs.

* http://localhost:8080/q/health
* http://localhost:8080/q/metrics
