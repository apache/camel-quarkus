= Camel Quarkus 2.0.0 Migration Guide

The following guide outlines how to adapt your code to changes that were made in Camel Quarkus 2.0.0 & Quarkus 2.0.0.Final.

== Changes in Quarkus

Please refer to https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/wiki/Migration-Guide-2.0[Quarkus 2.0.0 Migration Guide].

== Changes to the observability HTTP endpoint paths

In Quarkus 1.x, health and metrics endpoints were available at `/metrics` & `/health` context paths. In Quarkus 2.x this has changed with the addition of a mandatory `/q` path prefix. The endpoints are
now accessible at the following URLs.

* http://localhost:8080/q/health
* http://localhost:8080/q/metrics

== `camel-quarkus-main` artifact removed

Before Camel Quarkus 1.8.0, `camel-quarkus-main` used to be a full blown separate artifact.
In 1.8.0, all functionality of `camel-quarkus-main` was moved to `camel-quarkus-core`,
while it was still kept for backwards compatibility.
The empty `camel-quarkus-main` artifact was removed completely in Camel Quarkus 2.0.0.

As long as your application depends on any other Camel Quarkus extension, it is enough to remove the `camel-quarkus-main` dependency.
This is because all Camel Quarkus extensions transitively depend on `camel-quarkus-core` where the the original `camel-quarkus-main` functionality is hosted now.

== `camel-quarkus-xml-io` artifact replaced by `camel-quarkus-xml-io-dsl`

The functionality available in `camel-quarkus-xml-io` was moved to `camel-quarkus-xml-io-dsl` in Camel Quarkus 1.8.0.
Since that version `camel-quarkus-xml-io` was deprecated and was kept only for backwards compatibility reasons as an empty wrapper around `camel-quarkus-xml-io-dsl`.
`camel-quarkus-xml-io` was removed fully in Camel Quarkus 2.0.0 and you'll have to use `camel-quarkus-xml-io-dsl` as a replacement.

== `quarkus.camel.native.resources.*` replaced by `quarkus.native.resources.includes`

The `quarkus.camel.native.resources.include-patterns` and `quarkus.camel.native.resources.exclude-patterns` configuration properties were removed in Camel Quarkus 2.0.0.
Please use `quarkus.native.resources.includes` and `quarkus.native.resources.excludes` instead respectively.
