= Camel Quarkus 3.20.2 Migration Guide

The following guide outlines how to adapt your code to changes that were made in Camel Quarkus 3.20.2.

== `camel-quarkus-jolokia` `register-management-endpoint` default changed to `false`

When using `camel-quarkus-jolokia`, the `/q/jolokia` Quarkus management endpoint is no longer registered by default. It has been deprecated for removal in a future release.

If you need to restore the previous behavior and expose `/q/jolokia`, then you can add the following to `application.properties`.

[source]
----
quarkus.camel.jolokia.register-management-endpoint=true
----

However, as mentioned above, this option will eventually be removed.
