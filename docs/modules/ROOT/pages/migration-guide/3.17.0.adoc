= Camel Quarkus 3.17.0 Migration Guide

The following guide outlines how to adapt your code to changes that were made in Camel Quarkus 3.17.0.

== Reduced support when using Quarkus Amazon Services extensions with Camel Quarkus AWS2 extensions

Historically, the Camel Quarkus project tested & verified that using https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-amazon-services/1.x/index.html[Quarkus Amazon Services] extensions in conjunction with Camel Quarkus AWS2 extensions worked successfully.

From Camel Quarkus 3.17.0, this verification step ceases to exist and the Camel Quarkus AWS2 extension documentation no longer makes reference to Quarkus Amazon Services. 

If you want to leverage AWS support on Camel Quarkus, the recommended approach is to use the https://quarkus.io/extensions/?search-regex=camel-quarkus-aws2[camel-quarkus-aws2] extensions without Quarkus Amazon Services.
