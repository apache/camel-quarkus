The total number of completed exchanges

| Counter

|`camel.context.exchanges.failed.total`

The total number of failed exchanges

| Counter

|`camel.context.exchanges.inflight.total`

The total number of inflight exchanges

| Gauge

|`camel.context.exchanges.total`

The total number of all exchanges

|Metric Name | Type

|`camel.route.count`

You can also produce your own customized metrics in your Camel routes. For more information, refer to the https://camel.apache.org/components/latest/microprofile-metrics-component.html[microprofile-metrics] component documentation.

Metrics are exposed to Quarkus as application metrics and they can be browsed at http://localhost:8080/metrics/application.


== Additional Camel Quarkus configuration

The Camel MicroProfile Metrics extension exposes the following configuration properties.

[cols="80,.^10,.^10"]
|===
|Configuration property |Type |Default

|`quarkus.camel.metrics.enable-route-policy`

Set whether to enable the `MicroProfileMetricsRoutePolicyFactory` for capturing metrics on route processing times
|boolean
|`true`


|`quarkus.camel.metrics.enable-message-history`

Set whether to enable the `MicroProfileMetricsMessageHistoryFactory` for capturing metrics on individual route node processing times.

Depending on the number of configured route nodes, there is the potential to create a large volume of metrics. Therefore, this option is disabled by default.

|boolean
|`false`

|`quarkus.camel.metrics.enable-exchange-event-notifier`

Set whether to enable the `MicroProfileMetricsExchangeEventNotifier` for capturing metrics on exchange processing times.

|boolean
|`true`

|`quarkus.camel.metrics.enable-route-event-notifier`

Set whether to enable the `MicroProfileMetricsRouteEventNotifier` for capturing metrics on the total number of routes and total number of routes running.

|boolean
|`true`

|`quarkus.camel.metrics.enable-camel-context-event-notifier`

Set whether to enable the `MicroProfileMetricsCamelContextEventNotifier` for capturing metrics about the CamelContext, such as status and uptime.

|boolean
|`true`
|===
