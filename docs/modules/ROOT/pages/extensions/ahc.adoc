= Async HTTP Client (AHC) Extension

*Since Camel Quarkus 1.0.0*

The AHC component provides HTTP based endpoints for consuming external HTTP resources (as a client to call external
servers using HTTP). It is using the https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client[Async Http Client library]
under the hood.

Maven users will need to add the following dependency to their `pom.xml` for this extension.
