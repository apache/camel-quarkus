== Additional Camel Quarkus configuration

Beyond standard usages described above, a trick is needed when using jolt specs from classpath resources in native mode. In such a situation, one needs to explicitly embed the resources in the native executable by specifying the `include-patterns` option.

For instance, the route below would load the jolt spec from a classpath resource named _defaultr.json_:
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").to("jolt:defaultr.json");
----

In order to work in native mode the `include-patterns` configuration should be set. For instance, in the `application.properties` file as below :
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.camel.native.resources.include-patterns = *.json
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable could be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
