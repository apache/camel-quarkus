[[ReleaseGuide-ReleaseGuide]]
= Apache Camel Quarkus release process
:page-aliases: release-guide.adoc

The process is _mutatis mutandis_ the same as for the main Apache Camel repository - see
https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/release-guide.html With Camel Quarkus, adding `-Prelease` to
`release:prepare` and `release:perform` is not necessary. Given that you want to release version `0.1.0`,
the release command would be the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean release:clean release:prepare -DreleaseVersion=0.1.0 -DdevelopmentVersion=0.2.0-SNAPSHOT -B release:perform
----

In addition to the above, the following step is needed:

* After releasing the staging repository on https://oss.sonatype.org, update the value of `camel-quarkus-last-release`
attribute in the camel-quarkus https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/master/docs/antora.yml#L25[antora.yml component descriptor].
