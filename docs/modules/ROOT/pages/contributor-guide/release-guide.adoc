[[ReleaseGuide-ReleaseGuide]]
= Apache Camel Quarkus release process
:page-aliases: release-guide.adoc

The process is _mutatis mutandis_ the same as for the main Apache Camel repository - see the
https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/release-guide.html[Release guide] page of the Camel documentation.

Here, just a sketch of the repeating part, after you have performed the initial setup following the
https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/release-guide.html[Camel Release guide].

== Pre release tasks

* Check for an updated release of the https://github.com/amqphub/quarkus-qpid-jms[Quarkus Qpid JMS Extension] that aligns with the Quarkus version that Camel Quarkus is using. If one is available, update the `quarkus-qpid-jms.version` property in the project root `pom.xml`.

* Close the GitHub release https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/milestones[milestone] and assign any remaining issues that aren't covered by the release to the next milestone

== Create a release branch

[source,shell]
----
$ export VERSION=... # the version you are releasing, e.g. 0.1.0
$ export NEXT_VERSION=... # the next development iteration, e.g. 0.1.1-SNAPSHOT
$ git fetch upstream # upstream is git@github.com:apache/camel-quarkus.git
$ git checkout master # master is the branch from which you want to release
$ git reset --hard upstream/master # make sure you are in sync with upstream
$ git checkout -b release/$VERSION
----

== `release:prepare` and `release:perform`

With Camel Quarkus, adding `-Prelease` to `release:prepare` and `release:perform` is not necessary,
because all necessary profiles are set in the configuration of the `maven-release-plugin`.

The Maven command to release is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean release:clean release:prepare -DreleaseVersion=$VERSION -DdevelopmentVersion=$NEXT_VERSION -B release:perform
----

== Further steps

In addition to the above, the following is needed:

* After releasing the staging repository on https://repository.apache.org[https://repository.apache.org], update the
value of `camel-quarkus-last-release` attribute in the camel-quarkus
https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/master/docs/antora.yml#L25[antora.yml component descriptor].
