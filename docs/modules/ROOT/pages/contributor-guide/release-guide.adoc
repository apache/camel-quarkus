= Apache Camel Quarkus release process
:page-aliases: release-guide.adoc

The process is _mutatis mutandis_ the same as for the main Apache Camel repository - see the
xref:manual::release-guide.adoc[Release guide] page of the Camel documentation.

The process is oriented toward releasing the main branch, some adjustments might be needed when it come to releasing maintenance branches.

Here, just a sketch of the repeating part, after you have performed the initial setup following the
xref:manual::release-guide.adoc[Camel Release guide].

== Pre release tasks

* When releasing after a recent Quarkus release, check for new releases of third party Quarkus extensions we depend on.
  They are listed in the https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/main/pom.xml#L48-L61[Primary dependencies] section of the top level `pom.xml`.
  If there are new releases, upgrade the versions accordingly and run `mvn cq:sync-versions -N` from the root directory of the source tree.
* Close the GitHub release https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/milestones[milestone] and assign any remaining issues that aren't covered by the release to the next milestone

== Create a release branch

[source,shell]
----
$ export VERSION=$(mvn help:evaluate -Dexpression=project.version -q -DforceStdout | sed 's|-SNAPSHOT||') # the version you are releasing, e.g. 0.1.0
$ export NEXT_VERSION=$(echo ${VERSION} | awk -F. -v OFS=. '{$NF++;print}')-SNAPSHOT # the next development iteration, e.g. 0.1.1-SNAPSHOT
$ export BRANCH=$(echo $VERSION | sed 's|.[0-9][0-9]*$|.x|') # the release branch, e.g. 0.1.x
$ git fetch upstream # upstream is git@github.com:apache/camel-quarkus.git
$ git checkout main # main is the branch from which you want to release
$ git reset --hard upstream/main # make sure you are in sync with upstream
$ git checkout -b $BRANCH
----

== `release:prepare` and `release:perform`

With Camel Quarkus, adding `-Prelease` to `release:prepare` and `release:perform` is not necessary,
because all necessary profiles are set in the configuration of the `maven-release-plugin`.

The Maven command to release is as follows:

[source,shell]
----
$ mvn clean release:clean release:prepare -DreleaseVersion=$VERSION -DdevelopmentVersion=$NEXT_VERSION -B release:perform
----

In case `release:prepare` is successful but an issue occurs during `release:perform`, you can resume from the failing artifact to save some time:

* First find out from the console output, in which module the `release:perform` task failed.
  Say that there was an upload timeout in `camel-quarkus-openapi-java` module.
* Then locate the directory `mvn release:perform` used for checking out the tag and running the `deploy` goal.
  It is usually `<root_of_the_project>/target/checkout`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cd target/checkout
----
+
* And finally resume the `deploy` build as follows:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ mvn deploy -Papache-release -DskipTests -Denforcer.skip -Dquarkus.build.skip -Dformatter.skip -Dimpsort.skip -Dskip.installyarn -Dskip.yarn -rf :camel-quarkus-openapi-java
----

== Close the Apache staging repository

* Login to the https://repository.apache.org[Apache staging repository] using your Apache LDAP credentials.
* Click on `Staging Repositories`
* Then select `org.apache.camel-quarkus-xxx` in the list of repositories, where `xxx` represents your `username` and `ip`
* Click `Close` on the toolbar above
* This will close the repository from future deployments and make it available for others to view
* After that, a popup window is created, enter the name and version of the artifact being released in the `Description` field and finally click `Close`

== Collect the performance regression report

Once the staging repository has been closed, run the `perf-regression` tool in order to compare the current staging against the previous released version.

It's important that the machine running the `perf-regression` tool be equally loaded during the run.
The simplest way would be to take a 1 hour slot at the end of the day, launch the tool on your main station and then lock the screen.

For instance, running the tool to compare the `2.10.0` staging release against the `2.9.0` previous release would look as below:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd tooling/perf-regression
$ java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar -an 2.9.0 2.10.0
----

After approximately 1 hour, it should generate a report like below:

[source,shell]
----
 Camel Quarkus version  |  Duration  |   JVM req/s [%increase]   |  Native req/s [%increase]  |  Status  |
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 2.9.0  |       10m  |  16127.95 req/s [+0.00%]  |    9421.92 req/s [+0.00%]  |      OK  |
                2.10.0  |       10m  |  15334.57 req/s [-4.92%]  |    9044.55 req/s [-4.01%]  |      OK  |
----

Copy/paste the generated report into issue https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/4012[CAMEL-QUARKUS-4012].

The `perf-regression` tool has some options that could come in handy if one needs to:

* Specify the camel-quarkus staging repository url, e.g. when doing the release from a machine and checking regression from another
* Specify the camel staging repository url, e.g. when the camel release is still under vote
* Perform regression tests in JVM mode only, e.g. on machine where `quarkus.native.container-build` could not be used
* Run longer tests, e.g. to confirm that a potential regression detected with 10 minutes long scenarios remains with 1h long scenarios
* Run shorter tests, e.g. to have quick feedback when trying to tune the `perf-regression` tool options

For more details about options, please run:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd tooling/perf-regression
$ java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar --help
----

== Start an upstream vote

Send a mail to start the upstream vote.
There are plenty of mails on the dev mailing list to get inspiration from.
For instance, one could search mail with subject below:

[source,shell]
----
[VOTE] Release Camel Quarkus 3.0.0-M1
----

== Next version in Camel Quarkus main branch

If there are no substantial commits in the release branch, which need to get merged/cherry-picked to `main`, you can
perform this step right after creating the release branch. Otherwise, e.g. if there is a Camel upgrade in the release
branch which is not available on Maven Central yet, it is better to perform this step after the new Camel release is
available on the Central and after all relevant commits were merged/cherry-picked to `main`.

While in the release branch we set the `$NEXT_VERSION` to the next micro SNAPSHOT (e.g. when releasing `0.1.0`,
`$NEXT_VERSION` would be `0.1.1-SNAPSHOT`), in `main`, we typically set the next version to the next minor
SNAPSHOT (the next minor SNAPSHOT of `0.1.0` is `0.2.0-SNAPSHOT`).

[source,shell]
----
$ NEXT_RELEASE=... # e.g. 0.2.0
$ NEXT_SNAPSHOT="${NEXT_RELEASE}-SNAPSHOT"
$ git checkout "main"
$ git reset upstream/main
$ mvn release:update-versions -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -DdevelopmentVersion=$NEXT_SNAPSHOT -B
$ sed -i "s|<camel.quarkus.jvmSince>[^<]*</camel.quarkus.jvmSince>|<camel.quarkus.jvmSince>$NEXT_RELEASE</camel.quarkus.jvmSince>|" tooling/create-extension-templates/runtime-pom.xml
$ sed -i "s|<camel.quarkus.nativeSince>[^<]*</camel.quarkus.nativeSince>|<camel.quarkus.nativeSince>$NEXT_RELEASE</camel.quarkus.nativeSince>|" tooling/create-extension-templates/runtime-pom.xml
$ mvn cq:sync-versions -N
$ mvn clean install -Dquickly # to regen the Qute Camel component metadata + flattened boms
$ git commit -am "Next is $NEXT_SNAPSHOT"
# Send a pull request
----

== Close the upstream vote

After 72h, the vote may need to be closed.
There are plenty of mails on the dev mailing list to get inspiration from.
For instance, one could search mail with subject:

[source,shell]
----
[Result][VOTE] Release Apache Camel Quarkus 3.0.0-M1
----

== Release the Apache staging repository after the vote

* Login to the https://repository.apache.org[Apache staging repository] using your Apache LDAP credentials.
* Click on `Staging Repositories`
* Then select `org.apache.camel-quarkus-xxx` in the list of repositories, where `xxx` represents your `username` and `ip`
* Click `Release` on the toolbar above
* This will release the repository and make artifacts generally available
* After that, a popup window is created, click `Close`

== Update the Apache Camel Quarkus distribution subversion repository

Once the staging repository has been released, the Apache Camel Quarkus distribution subversion repository should be updated as sketched below.

If you are doing this for the first time you need to checkout the Apache Camel Quarkus distribution subversion repository:
[source,shell]
----
$ svn checkout 'https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/camel' camel-releases-dist
----

In case you have performed the above step during some release in the past, you need to update your working copy:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd camel-releases-dist
$ svn update .
----

Make sure your public key is present in the `KEYS` file. Add it, if it is not there yet using `gpg` command:

[source,shell]
----
$ export EMAIL= # the e-mail address in your key
$ gpg -k $EMAIL >> KEYS
$ gpg --armor --export $EMAIL >> KEYS
----

Assemble the Apache Camel Quarkus distribution:
[source,shell]
----
$ mkdir -p "camel-quarkus/$VERSION"
$ cd "camel-quarkus/$VERSION"
$ export URL='https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/camel/quarkus/camel-quarkus'
$ wget -O "apache-camel-quarkus-$VERSION-src.zip" "$URL/$VERSION/camel-quarkus-$VERSION-src.zip"
$ wget -O "apache-camel-quarkus-$VERSION-src.zip.asc" "$URL/$VERSION/camel-quarkus-$VERSION-src.zip.asc"
$ sha512sum "apache-camel-quarkus-$VERSION-src.zip" > "apache-camel-quarkus-$VERSION-src.zip.sha512"
----
Ensure that only the latest release from each maintained branches is present (including active LTS versions).
Typically, when releasing e.g. 1.4.0, you may need to delete e.g. 1.3.0:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd ..
$ ls
1.3.0 1.4.0
$ svn remove 1.3.0
----
Review the changes:
[source,shell]
----
$ cd ..
$ svn diff
----
Commit the changes:
[source,shell]
----
$ svn add --force .
$ svn commit -m "Apache Camel Quarkus $VERSION released artifacts"
----

== Upgrade Camel Quarkus in Quarkus Platform

You can proceed with upgrading Camel Quarkus in Quarkus Platform
once the newly released artifacts are available on https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/camel/quarkus/camel-quarkus-bom/[Maven Central].

[TIP]
====
Synchronization between Apache Maven repository and Maven Central may take hours.
You may find the `await-release` mojo of `cq-maven-plugin` handy if you need to upgrade Camel Quarkus in the Platform as soon as possible:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd camel-quarkus
$ mvn cq:await-release -Dcq.version=$(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)
----

The mojo first lists the artifacts having `groupId` `org.apache.camel.quarkus` and the given `$VERSION`
from the local Maven repository and then checks that they are available in Maven Central.
As long as there are unavailable artifacts, the requests are re-tried with a (configurable) delay of 60 seconds.
====

NOTE: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-platform[Quarkus Platform] hosts the metadata and Maven BOMs necessary for
https://{link-quarkus-code-generator}/[{link-quarkus-code-generator}] as well as for https://quarkus.io/guides/tooling[Quarkus tools].

* Clone Quarkus Platform unless you have done it in the past
+
[source,shell]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:quarkusio/quarkus-platform.git
----
+
* Change `camel-quarkus.version` property in the Quarkus platform top level `https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-platform/blob/main/pom.xml#L54[pom.xml]` to the newly released version:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ cd quarkus-platform
$ export NEW_VERSION=... # the version you just released, e.g. 0.1.0
$ sed -i "s|<camel-quarkus.version>[^<]*</camel-quarkus.version>|<camel-quarkus.version>$NEW_VERSION</camel-quarkus.version>|" pom.xml
# Make sure that it worked
$ git status
----
+
* Re-generate the BOMs
+
[source,shell]
----
$ ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
# ^ This will take a couple of minutes because it resolves
# every single dependency of every single extension included
# in the platform
#
# double check files are well formatted
$ ./mvnw -Dsync


# Then commit the generated changes
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Upgrade to Camel Quarkus $NEW_VERSION"
----
+
* Run Camel Quarkus integration tests at least in JVM mode:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd generated-platform-project/quarkus-camel/integration-tests
mvn clean test
----
+
* If all tests are passing, send a pull request to the Platform.
  If there are some new features, fixes, etc. in the release that would be worth to mention in the upcoming Quarkus announcement,
  you can tag the pull request with `release/noteworthy-feature` label and provide a short text about those features in the PR description.


== Create a GitHub release

This will trigger sending a notification to folks watching the Camel Quarkus github repository,
so it should ideally happen once the newly released artifacts are available on https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/camel/quarkus/camel-quarkus-bom/[Maven Central].

The following needs to be done:

* Go to https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/releases[https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/releases].
* Click the tag you want to promote to a GitHub release
* Click "Edit Tag" button
* In the "New release" form:
  * Leave "Release title" empty
  * Choose the tag of the previous release from the "Previous tag" select field
  * Click the "Generate release notes" button. It should generate a summary all changes for the release.
  * In addition you can add links to blog posts if required. e.g. something like
+
[source,markdown]
----
Check the full [release announcement](https://camel.apache.org/blog/2021/06/camel-quarkus-release-2.0.0/)
----
+
  * Click the green "Publish release" button at the bottom

== Upgrade and tag Examples

This section needs to be executed only when a Quarkus Platform release has been published.
It should be the case most of the time.
In this case, right after the newest Quarkus Platform becomes available on https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/quarkus/platform/quarkus-bom/[Maven Central]:

* Make sure all https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus-examples/pulls[PRs] against `camel-quarkus-main` branch are merged.
* Since Camel Quarkus 2.3.0, the examples should use Quarkus Platform BOMs in the `main` branch. To set it do the following:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ NEW_PLATFORM_VERSION=... # E.g. 2.2.0.Final
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout camel-quarkus-main
$ git reset --hard upstream/camel-quarkus-main
$ mvn org.l2x6.cq:cq-maven-plugin:2.10.0:examples-set-platform -Dcq.quarkus.platform.version=$NEW_PLATFORM_VERSION
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Upgrade to Quarkus Platform $NEW_PLATFORM_VERSION"
----
+
* Make sure that the tests are still passing:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ ./mvnw-for-each.sh clean verify -Pnative
----
+
* If everything works for you locally, open a PR to merge `camel-quarkus-main` to `main`
* Once the PR is merged, tag the `main` branch with the `$NEW_CQ_VERSION`:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ NEW_CQ_VERSION=... # the recent release of Camel Quarkus; e.g. 2.2.0
$ git checkout main
$ git fetch upstream
$ git reset --hard upstream/main
$ ./mvnw-for-each.sh versions:set -DnewVersion=$NEW_CQ_VERSION
# Update version labels in Kubernetes resources
$ ./mvnw process-sources -f file-bindy-ftp/pom.xml
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Tag $NEW_CQ_VERSION"
$ git tag $NEW_CQ_VERSION
$ git push upstream main
$ git push upstream $NEW_CQ_VERSION
# Create a maintenance branch for the release unless this is a micro release
$ export BRANCH=$(echo $NEW_CQ_VERSION | sed 's|.[0-9][0-9]*$|.x|')
$ git checkout -b $BRANCH $NEW_CQ_VERSION
$ git push upstream $BRANCH
----
+
* Prepare the `camel-quarkus-main` branch for the next development iteration:
+
[source,shell]
----
$ NEXT_CQ_VERSION=... # The version used in the current Camel Quarkus main branch without the -SNAPSHOT suffix; e.g. 2.3.0
$ git checkout camel-quarkus-main
$ git reset --hard main
$ ./mvnw org.l2x6.cq:cq-maven-plugin:2.10.0:examples-set-platform -Dcq.camel-quarkus.version=${NEXT_CQ_VERSION}-SNAPSHOT -Dcq.newVersion=${NEXT_CQ_VERSION}-SNAPSHOT
# Update version labels in Kubernetes resources
$ ./mvnw process-sources -f file-bindy-ftp/pom.xml
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Next is $NEXT_CQ_VERSION"
$ git push upstream camel-quarkus-main --force-with-lease
----

== Further steps

In addition to the above, the following is needed:

* https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/new[Create a ticket] asking a https://projects.apache.org/committee.html?camel[PMC member] to update the https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?camel[Apache Committee Report Helper]. The ticket title could be as follow.
  Release: The Apache Committee Report Helper should be updated by a PMC member as camel-quarkus-X.Y.Z has been released on YYYY-MM-DD.
* When writing the release announcement blog post, do not forget to add the release note section in https://github.com/apache/camel-website/tree/main/content/releases/q, and to add the branch for documentation in https://github.com/apache/camel-website/blob/main/antora-playbook-snippets/antora-playbook.yml[antora-playbook.yml].
