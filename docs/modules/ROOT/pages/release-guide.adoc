[[ReleaseGuide-ReleaseGuide]]
= Apache Camel Quarkus release process

The process is _mutatis mutandis_ the same as for the main Apache Camel repository - see
https://camel.apache.org/manual/latest/release-guide.html

In addition to the above, the following step is needed:

* After releasing the staging repository on https://oss.sonatype.org, update the value of `camel-quarkus-last-release`
attribute in the camel-quarkus https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/blob/master/docs/antora.yml#L25[antora.yml component descriptor].
