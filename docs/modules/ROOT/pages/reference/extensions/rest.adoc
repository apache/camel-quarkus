== Additional Camel Quarkus configuration

This extension depends on the xref:extensions/platform-http.adoc extension and configures it as the component that
provides the REST transport.

To use another REST transport provider, such as `netty-http` or `servlet`, you need to add the respective
extension as a dependency to your project and set the provider in your `RouteBuilder`. E.g. for `servlet`, you'd
have to add the `org.apache.camel.quarkus:camel-quarkus-servlet` dependency and the set the provider as
follows:

[source,java]
----
import org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder;

public class CamelRoute extends RouteBuilder {

    @Override
    public void configure() {
        restConfiguration()
                .component("servlet");
        ...
    }
}
