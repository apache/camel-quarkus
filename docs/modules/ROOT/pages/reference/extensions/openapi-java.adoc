Please refer to the above link for usage and configuration details.

== Maven coordinates

https://code.quarkus.io/?extension-search=camel-quarkus-openapi-java[Create a new project with this extension on code.quarkus.io, window="_blank"]

Or add the coordinates to your existing project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-openapi-java</artifactId>
</dependency>

Check the xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] for more information about writing Camel Quarkus applications.

== Camel Quarkus limitations

The `apiContextIdListing` configuration option is not supported. Since multiple `CamelContext`s are not supported and Quarkus applications run standalone, there
is no scenario where attempting to resolve OpenApi specifications for a specific `CamelContext` would be useful. It also introduces some additional overhead of
requiring JMX (which is not supported in native mode) & additional Camel Quarkus extensions for processing XML.
