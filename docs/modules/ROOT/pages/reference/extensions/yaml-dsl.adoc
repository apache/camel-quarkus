== Usage
[id="extensions-yaml-dsl-usage-native-mode"]
=== Native mode

The following constructs when defined within Camel YAML DSL markup, require you to register classes for reflection. Refer to the xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#reflection[Native mode] guide for details.

[id="extensions-yaml-dsl-usage-bean-definitions"]
==== Bean definitions

The YAML DSL provides the capability to define beans as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
- beans:
    - name: "greetingBean"
      type: "org.acme.GreetingBean"
      properties:
        greeting: "Hello World!"
- route:
    id: "my-yaml-route"
    from:
      uri: "timer:from-yaml?period=1000"
      steps:
        - to: "bean:greetingBean"
----

In this example, the `GreetingBean` class needs to be registered for reflection. This applies to any types that you refer to under the `beans` key in your YAML routes.

[source,java]
----
@RegisterForReflection
public class GreetingBean {
}
----

[id="extensions-yaml-dsl-usage-exception-handling"]
==== Exception handling

Camel provides various methods of handling exceptions. Some of these require that any exception classes referenced in their DSL definitions are registered for reflection.

`*on-exception*`

[source,yaml]
----
- on-exception:
    handled:
      constant: "true"
    exception:
      - "org.acme.MyHandledException"
    steps:
      - transform:
          constant: "Sorry something went wrong"
----

[source,java]
----
@RegisterForReflection
public class MyHandledException {
}
----

`*throw-exception*`

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    id: "my-yaml-route"
    from:
      uri: "direct:start"
      steps:
        - choice:
            when:
              - simple: "${body} == 'bad value'"
                steps:
                  - throw-exception:
                      exception-type: "org.acme.ForcedException"
                      message: "Forced exception"
            otherwise:
              steps:
                - to: "log:end"
----

[source,java]
----
@RegisterForReflection
public class ForcedException {
}
----

`*do-catch*`

[source,yaml]
----
- route:
    id: "my-yaml-route2"
    from:
      uri: "direct:tryCatch"
      steps:
        - do-try:
            steps:
              - to: "direct:readFile"
            do-catch:
              - exception:
                  - "java.io.FileNotFoundException"
                steps:
                  - transform:
                      constant: "do-catch caught an exception"
----

[source,java]
----
@RegisterForReflection(targets = FileNotFoundException.class)
public class MyClass {
}

== Additional Camel Quarkus configuration

|icon:lock[title=Fixed at build time] [[quarkus.camel.yaml.flow-mode]]`link:#quarkus.camel.yaml.flow-mode[quarkus.camel.yaml.flow-mode]`

If `true` the YAML DSL supports flow-mode. This allows you to write more concise routes for EIPs that have their own output like filter, aggregate, split, etc. the `steps` element can be omitted and in that case, the next processing step is automatically wired to the EIPs outputs. 
For example, a YAML route to process only the timer events from 5 to 10 would look like: `- from:
    uri: "timer:tick"
    steps:
      - filter:
          simple: "$++{++exchangeProperty.CamelTimerCounter` range '5..10'" steps: - to: "direct:filtered" ++}++  With the flow mode enabled the same logic can be expressed in a more concise way: `- from:
    uri: "kamelet:source"
    steps:
      - filter:
          simple: "$++{++exchangeProperty.CamelTimerCounter` range '5..10'" - to: "kamelet:sink" ++}++
| `boolean`
| `true`
