|icon:lock[title=Fixed at build time] [[quarkus.camel.yaml.flow-mode]]`link:#quarkus.camel.yaml.flow-mode[quarkus.camel.yaml.flow-mode]`

If `true` the YAML DSL support flow-mode which allow to write more concise routes as for EIPs that have their own output like filter, aggregate, split, etc. the `steps` element can be omitted an in that case, the next processing step is automatically wired to the EIP's outputs. 
As example, a YAML DSL to process only the timer events from 5 to 10 would look like: `- from:
    uri: "timer:tick"
    steps:
      - filter:
          simple: "$++{++exchangeProperty.CamelTimerCounter` range '5..10'" steps: - to: "direct:filtered" ++}++  With the flow mode enabled the same logic can be expressed in a more concise way: `- from:
    uri: "kamelet:source"
    steps:
      - filter:
          simple: "$++{++exchangeProperty.CamelTimerCounter` range '5..10'" - to: "kamelet:sink" ++}++
