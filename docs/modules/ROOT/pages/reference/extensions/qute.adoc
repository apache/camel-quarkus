== Usage

Please refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/qute[Quarkus Qute].


== Camel Quarkus limitations

== allowContextMapAll option in native mode

The `allowContextMapAll` option is not supported in native mode as it requires reflective access to security sensitive camel core classes such as
`CamelContext` & `Exchange`. This is considered a security risk and thus access to the feature is not provided by default.



== Additional Camel Quarkus configuration

By default, all files located in the src/main/resources/templates directory and its subdirectories
are registered as templates. Templates are validated during startup and watched for changes in the
development mode.
