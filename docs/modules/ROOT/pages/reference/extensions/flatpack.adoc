== Additional Camel Quarkus configuration

This component typically loads Flatpack mappings from classpath.
To make it work also in native mode, you need to explicitly embed the mappings in the native executable
by using the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` property.

For instance, the route below loads the Flatpack mappings from a classpath resource named `mappings/simple.pzmap.xml`:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").to("flatpack:delim:mappings/simple.pzmap.xml");
----

To include this (an possibly other mappings stored in `.pzmap.xml` files under the `mappings` directory) in the native image, you would have to add something like the following to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = mappings/*.pzmap.xml
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
