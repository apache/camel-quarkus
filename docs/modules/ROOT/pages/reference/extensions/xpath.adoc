This component is able to load xpath expressions from classpath resources.
To make it work also in native mode, you need to explicitly embed the expression files in the native executable
by using the `quarkus.native.resources.includes` property.

For instance, the route below would load an XPath expression from a classpath resource named `myxpath.txt`:

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").transform().xpath("resource:classpath:myxpath.txt");
----

To include this (an possibly other expressions stored in `.txt` files) in the native image, you would have to add something like the following to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = *.txt
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
