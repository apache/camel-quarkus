[id="extensions-core-configuration-simple-language"]
=== Simple language

[id="extensions-core-configuration-using-the-ognl-notation"]
==== Using the OGNL notation
When using the OGNL notation from the simple language, the `camel-quarkus-bean` extension should be used.

For instance, the simple expression below is accessing the `getAddress()` method on the message body of type `Client`.
[source,java]
---
simple("${body.address}")
---

In such a situation, one should take an additional dependency on the camel-quarkus-bean extension xref:{cq-camel-components}::bean-component.adoc[as described here].
Note that in native mode, some classes may need to be registered for reflection. In the example above, the `Client` class
needs to be link:https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-native-applications-tips#registering-for-reflection[registered for reflection].

[id="extensions-core-configuration-using-dynamic-type-resolution-in-native-mode"]
==== Using dynamic type resolution in native mode
When dynamically resolving a type from simple expressions like:

 * `simple("${mandatoryBodyAs(TYPE)}")`
 * `simple("${type:package.Enum.CONSTANT}")`
 * `from("...").split(bodyAs(TYPE.class))`
 * `simple("$\{body} is TYPE")`

It may be needed to register some classes for reflection manually.

For instance, the simple expression below is dynamically resolving the type `java.nio.ByteBuffer` at runtime:
[source,java]
---
simple("${body} is 'java.nio.ByteBuffer'")
---

As such, the class `java.nio.ByteBuffer` needs to be link:https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-native-applications-tips#registering-for-reflection[registered for reflection].

[id="extensions-core-configuration-using-the-simple-language-with-classpath-resources-in-native-mode"]
==== Using the simple language with classpath resources in native mode

If your route is supposed to load a Simple script from classpath, like in the following example

[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").transform().simple("resource:classpath:mysimple.txt");
----

then you need to use Quarkus `quarkus.native.resources.includes` property to include the resource in the native executable
as demonstrated below:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.native.resources.includes = mysimple.txt
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable can be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].

[id="extensions-core-configuration-configuring-a-custom-bean-via-properties-in-native-mode"]
==== Configuring a custom bean via properties in native mode
When specifying a custom bean via properties in native mode with configuration like `#class:*` or `#type:*`, it may be needed to register some classes for reflection manually.

For instance, the custom bean definition below involves the use of reflection for bean instantiation and setter invocation:
[source,properties]
---
camel.beans.customBeanWithSetterInjection = #class:org.example.PropertiesCustomBeanWithSetterInjection
camel.beans.customBeanWithSetterInjection.counter = 123
---

As such, the class `PropertiesCustomBeanWithSetterInjection` needs to be link:https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-native-applications-tips#registering-for-reflection[registered for reflection], note that field access could be omitted in this case.

A comma-separated list of Ant-path style patterns to match Camel service definition files in the classpath. The services defined in the matching files will *not* be discoverable via the **`org.apache.camel.spi.FactoryFinder` mechanism.

The excludes have higher precedence than includes. The excludes defined here can also be used to veto the discoverability of services included by Camel Quarkus extensions.

Note that Camel Quarkus extensions may include some services by default. The services selected here added to those services and the exclusions defined in `exclude-patterns` are applied to the union set.

Used for exclusive filtering scanning of RouteBuilder classes. The exclusive filtering takes precedence over inclusive filtering. The pattern is using Ant-path style pattern.

|icon:lock[title=Fixed at build time] [[quarkus.camel.native.reflection.exclude-patterns]]`link:#quarkus.camel.native.reflection.exclude-patterns[quarkus.camel.native.reflection.exclude-patterns]`

A comma separated list of Ant-path style patterns to match class names that should be *excluded* from registering for reflection. Use the class name format as returned by the `java.lang.Class.getName()` method: package segments delimited by period `.` and inner classes by dollar sign `$`.

This option narrows down the set selected by `include-patterns`. By default, no classes are excluded.

This option cannot be used to unregister classes which have been registered internally by Quarkus extensions.

|icon:lock[title=Fixed at build time] [[quarkus.camel.native.reflection.include-patterns]]`link:#quarkus.camel.native.reflection.include-patterns[quarkus.camel.native.reflection.include-patterns]`

A comma separated list of Ant-path style patterns to match class names that should be registered for reflection. Use the class name format as returned by the `java.lang.Class.getName()` method: package segments delimited by period `.` and inner classes by dollar sign `$`.

By default, no classes are included. The set selected by this option can be narrowed down by `exclude-patterns`.

Note that Quarkus extensions typically register the required classes for reflection by themselves. This option is useful in situations when the built in functionality is not sufficient.

Note that this option enables the full reflective access for constructors, fields and methods. If you need a finer grained control, consider using `io.quarkus.runtime.annotations.RegisterForReflection` annotation in your Java code.

For this option to work properly, at least one of the following conditions must be satisfied:

 - There are no wildcards (`++*++` or `/`) in the patterns
 - The artifacts containing the selected classes contain a Jandex index (`META-INF/jandex.idx`)
 - The artifacts containing the selected classes are registered for indexing using the `quarkus.index-dependency.++*++` family of options in `application.properties` - e.g.

```
quarkus.index-dependency.my-dep.group-id = org.my-group
quarkus.index-dependency.my-dep.artifact-id = my-artifact
```

where `my-dep` is a label of your choice to tell Quarkus that `org.my-group` and with `my-artifact` belong together.
