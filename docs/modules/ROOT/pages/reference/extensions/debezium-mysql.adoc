Capture changes from a MySQL database.

== What's inside

* xref:latest@components::debezium-mysql-component.adoc[Debezium MySQL Connector component], URI syntax: `debezium-mysql:name`

Please refer to the above link for usage and configuration details.

== Maven coordinates

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-debezium-mysql</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Check the xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] for more information about writing Camel Quarkus applications.

== Usage

We cannot add the MySQL JDBC driver as a compile scope dependency of this extension because it is GPL2 licensed and it
would be against the policy of the Apache Software Foundation.

Therefore you have to add the dependency to your project yourself, as long as you are able to comply with its license
terms.

`quarkus-bom` (transitively included by `camel-quarkus-bom` and `quarkus-universe-bom`) manages a version
of `mysql:mysql-connector-java` compatible with Camel Quarkus. So you do not need specify the version of the
driver if you import any of the mentioned BOMs. The following should be sufficient for Maven:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>mysql</groupId>
    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
</dependency>
----


== Camel Quarkus limitations

While you can use any of the available Kafka offset stores in JVM mode, only the following offset stores are supported
in native mode:

* `org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.FileOffsetBackingStore`
* `org.apache.kafka.connect.storage.MemoryOffsetBackingStore`

Please file an https://github.com/apache/camel-quarkus/issues/new[issue] if you are missing some specific offset store
in native mode.
