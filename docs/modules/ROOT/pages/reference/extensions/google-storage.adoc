Store and retrieve objects from Google Cloud Storage Service using the google-cloud-storage library.

== What's inside

* xref:{cq-camel-components}::google-storage-component.adoc[Google Storage component], URI syntax: `google-storage:bucketName`

Please refer to the above link for usage and configuration details.

== Maven coordinates

https://code.quarkus.io/?extension-search=camel-quarkus-google-storage[Create a new project with this extension on code.quarkus.io, window="_blank"]

Or add the coordinates to your existing project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-google-storage</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Check the xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] for more information about writing Camel Quarkus applications.

== SSL in native mode

This extension auto-enables SSL support in native mode. Hence you do not need to add
`quarkus.ssl.native=true` to your `application.properties` yourself. See also
https://quarkus.io/guides/native-and-ssl[Quarkus SSL guide].

== Additional Camel Quarkus configuration

There are two different configuration approaches:

* Google storage client can be defined via quarkus properties leveraging the Quarkiverse - Google Cloud Services - Storage (see https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-google-cloud-services/blob/main/storage[extension git page]).
Camel will autowire client into the Google-storage component.
This configuration allows definition of only one storage client, therefore it isn't possible to define several different endpoints, which run together.

* When multiple storage clients are needed, one or more storage client bean need to be registered in the registry (e.g. via a CDI bean producer). Each storage client bean could then be referenced from distinct endpoints.
