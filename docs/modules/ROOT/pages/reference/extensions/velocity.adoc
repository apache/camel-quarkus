Transform messages using a Velocity template.

== What's inside

* xref:{cq-camel-components}::velocity-component.adoc[Velocity component], URI syntax: `velocity:resourceUri`

Please refer to the above link for usage and configuration details.

== Maven coordinates

[source,xml]

</dependency>

Check the xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] for more information about writing Camel Quarkus applications.

== allowContextMapAll option in native mode

The `allowContextMapAll` option is not supported in native mode as it requires reflective access to security sensitive camel core classes such as
`CamelContext` & `Exchange`. This is considered a security risk and thus access to the feature is not provided by default.

== Additional Camel Quarkus configuration

Beyond standard usages described above, a trick is needed when using velocity templates from classpath resources in native mode. In such a situation, one needs to explicitly embed the resources in the native executable by specifying the `include-patterns` option.

For instance, the route below would load the velocity template from a classpath resource named _template/simple.vm_:
[source,java]
----
from("direct:start").to("velocity://template/simple.vm");
----

In order to work in native mode the `include-patterns` configuration should be set. For instance, in the `application.properties` file as below :
[source,properties]
----
quarkus.camel.native.resources.include-patterns = template/*.vm
----

More information about selecting resources for inclusion in the native executable could be found at xref:user-guide/native-mode.adoc#embedding-resource-in-native-executable[Embedding resource in native executable].
