== Maven coordinates

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-activemq</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Check the xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] for more information about writing Camel Quarkus applications.

== Camel Quarkus limitations

ActiveMQ https://activemq.apache.org/selectors.html[XPath selectors] are disabled in native mode as the functionality depends on `activemq-broker`. This dependency 
is excluded from the dependency tree, since none of the ActiveMQ broker functionality is supported in native mode.


== SSL in native mode

This extension auto-enables SSL support in native mode. Hence you do not need to add
`quarkus.ssl.native=true` to your `application.properties` yourself. See also
https://quarkus.io/guides/native-and-ssl[Quarkus SSL guide].
