== Camel Quarkus limitations

CSimple language is supported only in

* XML DSL
* Java DSL when implemented in a class extending `org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder`

The compilation of CSimple scripts happens at build time. To be able to discover the scripts in the route definitions,
those definitions need to get assembled at build time. When extending
`org.apache.camel.builder.RouteBuilder`, this basically means instantiating your `RouteBuilder`, setting
a fake `CamelContext` instance on it and calling its `configure()` method. It may fail if your `configure()`
method attempts to access some resource that is only available at runtime.

You can use the `quarkus.camel.csimple.on-build-time-analysis-failure` configuration parameter to decide
what should happen in such cases. Possible values are `warn` (default), `fail` or `ignore`.

[WARNING]
====
CSimple language will not work on Camel Quarkus if used in a `org.apache.camel.builder.LambdaRouteBuilder`
