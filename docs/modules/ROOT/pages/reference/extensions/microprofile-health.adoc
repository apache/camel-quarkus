Please refer to the above link for usage and configuration details.

== Maven coordinates

Or add the coordinates to your existing project:

[source,xml]

    <artifactId>camel-quarkus-microprofile-health</artifactId>
</dependency>

Check the xref:user-guide/index.adoc[User guide] for more information about writing Camel Quarkus applications.

== Usage

You can register health checks for your applications with the xref:manual::health-check.adoc[Camel health check API].

By default, classes extending `AbstractHealthCheck` are registered as both liveness and readiness checks. You can override the `isReadiness` method to control this behaviour.

Any checks provided by your application are automatically discovered and bound to the Camel registry. They will be available via
the Quarkus health endpoints `/q/health/live` and `/q/health/ready`.

You can also provide custom `HealthCheckRepository` implementations and these are also automatically discovered and bound to the Camel registry for you.

Refer to the https://quarkus.io/guides/health-guide[Quarkus health guide] for further information.

=== Provided health checks

Some checks are automatically registered for your application.

==== Camel Context Health

Inspects the Camel Context status and causes the health check status to be `DOWN` if the status is anything other than 'Started'.

==== Camel Route Health

Inspects the status of each route and causes the health check status to be `DOWN` if any route status is not 'Started'.
